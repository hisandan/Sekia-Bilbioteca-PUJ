       " \"AB The traditional reading of Marx as a continuation of Hegel, but atheist and economic or historical determinist, falsifies the German thinker's own thinking. Alfred Schmidt and Enrique Dussel, among others, show to what extent this is an unknown Marx even in the academic circles. This ignorance is an inevitable banalization of his legacy, which hinders the pedagogical-political exercise that can inspire social progress in Latin America. Clarifying in what do these views fail allows us to find critique of Eurocentric reason, even if Marx himself was Eurocentric. Such reading is made possible by redefining these aspects usually associated with Marxism and looking to what extent it is Post-Eurocentric. It is about questioning the conceptions of history, science and nature, around the materialistic anthropology - not ontological- present in Marx's We propose to reflect on these four problematic lines around Hegel and Marx - atheism, economic and historical determinism, the idea of history and the relationship between science and nature - that are constructed in the light of Marxist materialist philosophy. From the relationships put into action there it would be possible to establish the basis of an understanding of nature -the earth and the body- beyond the bias of instrumental, ecocide, immoral and desacralizing reason. A conception that could enter into dialogue with the indigenous worldviews of the planet.\\n\",\n",

To this end, a literature review was compiled from different databases by running a descriptive data analysis according to the categories generated for this intention. It was noticed that electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) have begun to be used for this purpose with EEG as the most frequent. The procedure of potentials related to events is currently the most used for the deceit detection in the psycho-physiology field. No studies were found in Spanish speaking countries. The United States, China and England were identified as the main source of information in this field. Recent studies show an increase in understanding the brain processes produced at the time of deceiving.

For this, 363,439 administrative records collected by the National Police from March 16 to May 1, 2020 regarding BCCs were analysed, all including the following information: time, day, date, type of behaviour, age and state or department of the offender. The results showed: (a) temporal relationships between the number of daily or accumulated cases of COVID-19 and the rates of BCCs per 100,000 inhabitants, (b) concentration of BCCs between 8:00 am and 12:00 pm or between 2:00 pm and 6 pm, (c) greater frequency of alcoholic beverage consumption on weekends, (d) in relation to age, the 18-24 age group had the highest number of corrective measures.\\n',\n",

Although it is possible to consider these two clauses to have a retributive purpose, the research shows that only penalty clauses are punishing measures. While the discounts for quality indicators clauses are meant to maintain an equitable distribution amongst the rights and duties acquired by the parties, the imposition of fines punishes a delayed or incomplete contract performance. This distinction allows us to conclude that in cases where an agency imposes both a discount and a fine to a contractor who breaches quality indicators standards under the contract, the Administration does not violate the principle of non bis in idem.\\n',\n",

The High Tribunal recognized this new fundamental right from the sentence T-057 of 2015, considering that the denial of these medical procedures could suppose the violation of the right to health and the life of its receivers. The inclusion of this right was not peaceful within constitutional jurisprudence, to the extent that there was a line of precedents that denied access to experimental treatments, because they were excluded from the health system and not accredited by the scientific community.\\n',\n",

       " 'AB The article analyzes the configuration and reconfiguration of mobilities and territorialities of street inhabitants in Bogota, amidst the tensions between the urban public space conceived by hegemonic knowledge/powers and built from the meanings, uses, and everyday experiences of the city. It proposes a two-stage reading of conceptual axes of the research, namely street inhabitants, territoriality, mobility, and public space. The first one in context shows the panorama of the mobilities and territorialities configuration based on the tension between a growing capital city and a process of fragmentation and compared to street territorialities. This goes from a relatively open and free relationship with public space to an ambivalent where the \"pots\" become a space of degradation but at the same time, a place that represents security in the face of indifference, persecution and \"social cleansing\". The second stage identifies the forms of reconfiguration of mobilities and territorialities of street inhabitants, after the intervention of the Bronx, on May 28, 2016.\\n',\n",
       " '   This research proposes a qualitative approach to identify the logic of the mobility of street inhabitants in Bogota during these stages, implementing a strategy of information collection with techniques as the documentary review of previous research on urban public space and the historical development of this population group; interviews with street inhabitants in different locations of the city; interview with a street care services operator; interview with an academic expert; ethnographic observation and analysis of figures from the 2007 and 2017 street population censuses. The findings prove that, although mobility constitutes a survival strategy for the street inhabitant mediated by needs and economic activities, practices, and links with the territory and its peers, it also responds to a fragmentation process and discontinuity in the city that creates enclaves of informality and conditions/limits such mobility. With this, transits and tensions between voluntary and involuntary mobility are identified.\\n',\n",

There are concerns that growing up in this kind of family produces adverse effects. This document aims to respond through a review of the literature if there are differences between biological children or children adopted by homosexual parents in psychological adjustment, development of sexuality, stigmatization and cognitive performance. Through the search in the PubMed database, 204 articles were found in total, 18 articles were selected that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, which include approximately 1700 children with different types of families. In conclusion, the quality of the studies does not allow to generate degrees of recommendation for answering whether the welfare of these children is equal, better or worse than the children raised by heterosexual parents. However, a certain tendency and consistency among the studies shows that there is no difference in the psychological well-being or the development of sexuality between these two groups of families. In contrast, there is a greater possibility of stigmatization, a variable that does not depend itself on the conformation of the family or the sexual orientation of the parents, but depends on external factors such as the social and educational environment of the child and his peers.\\n',\n",

A sample of 600 participants between 18 to 65 years old were selected using a non-probabilistic sampling for availability (M = 29, SD = 10.7). A 30 items inventory that measure the adherence to the roles of hegemonic masculinity modified version MNRI-M was applied. Exploratory Factor Analysis EFA showed five factors that explain 64 % of the common variance. Confirmatory Factor Analysis CFA confirmed very good fit of this penta-factorial model in a reduced version of 17 items S-B x(2) = 343.29, gl = 109, NNFI = 0.97; CFI = 0.98. RMSEA = 0.06 IC95 % (0.053, 0.067). Internal consistency, Alpha and Omega coefficients, were between 0.70 and 0.79. Constructed roles of hegemonic masculinity discriminated adequately according to age, educational level, socioeconomic classification, and occupation. It is concluded that MNRI-M has adequate psychometric properties.\\n',\n",

       " '   Results: in more than 30% of the municipalities evaluated, the presence of aluminum in the water for human consumption was evidenced, above the maximum allowed by the current regulations.

For this, the concepts and technics used in various bioart works created from the end of the twentieth century are analyzed in the scope of traditional intellectual property postulates, according to ACN regulations, and national and international jurisprudence and doctrine. Considering that bioart is the product of a complex relationship between art and science, this article is divided into two sections: the first section covers bioart in the scope of copyright, including non-protection of ideas, irrelevance of merit, and originality, intellectual creation, and fixation criteria; and the second section covers bioart in the scope of patent law, including eligibility, patentability requirements, and freedom to operate.

       " 'AB For the present study, rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L. var. Israeli) samples of 6 and 24 months of transplanted were collected from organic crops located in the high Andean area of Colombia. They were submitted to extraction of essential oil by steam distillation in Prototype equipment made of stainless steel. These oils were analyzed using GC-MS, to determine the chemical components present in these samples and the relative proportion. In order to know the existence of variations in the composition of the oil obtained, simultaneous extractions were carried out in the laboratory with an equipment of the same characteristics but made of glass. These samples were analyzed by GC-MS and therefore, it was obtained that the oils extracted in the prototype are composed in greater amount by monoterpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes, contrary to those obtained in the laboratory, where most were oxygenated monoterpenes. Eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, camphor, beta-caryophyllene, bornyl acetate, camphene, beta-pinene, limonene, phellandrene and gamma-terpinene were the major compounds in all samples analyzed, but in oils extracted in the prototype for plants of 24 months, the majority compound was alpha-pinene, unlike the one obtained in the laboratory for the same sample, where the compound with the highest presence was Eucalyptol. As for camphor, beta-careophilene and bornyl acetate, showed a decrease in their presence in the oils extracted in the prototype in plants of 24 and 6 months, contrary to camphene, beta-pinene and limonene, that increased their relative concentration in the oils extracted in the prototype, showing differences in oils extracted in each of the study equipment.\\n',\n",

By using legal sociology both the labor law and its application are approached from a documentary analysis methodology from Colombian labor reality as an academic input with regard to the protection and warranty of the freedom of association. The purpose is to conclude that this coexistence is a jurisprudence's outcome contrario sensu to international agreements of freedom of association.\\n\",\n",

The aim is to analyze whether the aforementioned countries follow parameters and recommendations defined in international treaties. Starting with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to more recent documents, education was treated as a priority in childhood and adolescence, with the purpose of promoting the development of the integral personality of the human being. This includes attention to the teaching of sexuality as a way to provide conditions for access to information, public health and personal, professional and economic growth. This turns the theme as a strategic action of human rights, with a bias to promote well-being, respect and citizenship through a healthy, safe and productive life.\\n',\n",
