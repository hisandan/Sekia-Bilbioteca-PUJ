TI Critique of Eurocentric reason through the concept of nature in Marx:

SO CUADERNOS DE FILOSOFIA LATINOAMERICANA
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Materialism; ethics; formal logic; Eurocentrism; dialectical logic;
   language; theological monism
AB The traditional reading of Marx as a continuation of Hegel, but atheist and economic or historical determinist, falsifies the German thinker's own thinking. Alfred Schmidt and Enrique Dussel, among others, show to what extent this is an unknown Marx even in the academic circles. This ignorance is an inevitable banalization of his legacy, which hinders the pedagogical-political exercise that can inspire social progress in Latin America. Clarifying in what do these views fail allows us to find critique of Eurocentric reason, even if Marx himself was Eurocentric. Such reading is made possible by redefining these aspects usually associated with Marxism and looking to what extent it is Post-Eurocentric. It is about questioning the conceptions of history, science and nature, around the materialistic anthropology - not ontological- present in Marx's We propose to reflect on these four problematic lines around Hegel and Marx - atheism, economic and historical determinism, the idea of history and the relationship between science and nature - that are constructed in the light of Marxist materialist philosophy. From the relationships put into action there it would be possible to establish the basis of an understanding of nature -the earth and the body- beyond the bias of instrumental, ecocide, immoral and desacralizing reason. A conception that could enter into dialogue with the indigenous worldviews of the planet.

AB This article seeks to confront Alvin Plantinga's call to Christian philosophers to assume the interests of the community to which they belong with Ivan Garzon's analysis of the place of religion in the exercise of public reason. The purpose is to examine the changes that have taken place, within liberal political thought, in relation to the place of religion in the organization of society. This raises new challenges for believers to achieve, from their religious convictions, their active participation in the organization of societies that accomplish the establishment of forms of peaceful coexistence that respect the growing cultural diversity of citizens.

AB This investigation aimed to identify the instruments, measures, procedures and background of studies produced for deceit detection by using psycho-physiological actions in the last five years (2011-2016). To this end, a literature review was compiled from different databases by running a descriptive data analysis according to the categories generated for this intention. It was noticed that electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) have begun to be used for this purpose with EEG as the most frequent. The procedure of potentials related to events is currently the most used for the deceit detection in the psycho-physiology field. No studies were found in Spanish speaking countries. The United States, China and England were identified as the main source of information in this field. Recent studies show an increase in understanding the brain processes produced at the time of deceiving. Nevertheless, these studies spark an ethical debate about the implications with respect to human freedom and self-incrimination.

DE Intelligent lighting system; ZigBee; Wi-Fi; wireless sensor networks;
   IoT; Industry 4.0
AB Introduction- Intelligent lighting using the Internet of Things (IoT) and different interconnection mechanisms is a field of research that is becoming increasingly relevant worldwide.
   Objective- The article presents an intelligent LED lighting model using the IoT and two interconnectivity mechanisms: ZigBee & Wi-Fi.
   Methodology- The model uses LEDs (light emitting diode), RGB LEDs, monitoring and control of light intensity variables, measurements of environmental variables by sensors, and actuators coupled to the control devices. The model allows wireless networks to be interconnected with cellular mobile service based on the ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) and Wi-Fi (802.11a / g) protocols, and complies with the ANSI / ISA 100.11.a standard.
   Results- The model supports access to remote devices, with great scalability and coverage, such as a gateway for the interconnection of LAN networks with WAN networks. This enables a series of applications through electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers and touch panels, distributed in the physical plant.
   Conclusions- The intelligent lighting model presented in this article has been widely applied in different civil construction projects, both public and private. It has served as a benchmark that allows to offer advantages such as energy saving and automation of homes and offices (domotics).

DE Public Procurement; Discount Quality Indicators Clauses; Penalty
   Clauses; Breach of Contract; Principle Non Bis in Idem
AB The free configuration of public procurements enables the parties to include provisions directed to ensure their completion and performance, such as the discounts for quality indicators and the penalty clauses. Although it is possible to consider these two clauses to have a retributive purpose, the research shows that only penalty clauses are punishing measures. While the discounts for quality indicators clauses are meant to maintain an equitable distribution amongst the rights and duties acquired by the parties, the imposition of fines punishes a delayed or incomplete contract performance. This distinction allows us to conclude that in cases where an agency imposes both a discount and a fine to a contractor who breaches quality indicators standards under the contract, the Administration does not violate the principle of non bis in idem.

AB Decomposing the Farnsworth house through its absolute elements reveals the essence of the architecture of Mies van der Rohe, showing that each device has its own universe, which, when arranged in a complete entity, achieves the compactness of a piece of universal art. Here the house is analyzed through one of its most innovative devices, which evidences the lightness conferred to it by being separated from the natural floor. This is an operation that emphasizes the abstraction of a fairly recurrent device in his architecture, creating a new floor plan by erecting his buildings on podiums or platforms. This analysis deepens the study of the elements that make up this dematerialized podium based on Mies' Baukunst, a look that has found answers in a panorama of primary sources that reveal Mies' method of "building with art."

SO REVISTA CES DERECHO

DT Article
AB The Constitutional Court has incorporated the "righ to try" as an unnamed right that allows people to access experimental treatments or medications nationally and abroad, departing from the law 1751 of 2015 that prohibits the provision of this type of intervention for patients, because it does not have a degree of efficacy or scientific certainty about its effects. The High Tribunal recognized this new fundamental right from the sentence T-057 of 2015, considering that the denial of these medical procedures could suppose the violation of the right to health and the life of its receivers. The inclusion of this right was not peaceful within constitutional jurisprudence, to the extent that there was a line of precedents that denied access to experimental treatments, because they were excluded from the health system and not accredited by the scientific community.
   In that order of ideas, the present article, aims to analyze the jurisprudential evolution on the applicability of this type of procedures in the health system, later it is intended to examine the incorporation of the "righ to try" within this whole of constitutional precedents, and finally they will identify the main sub-rules that must be fulfilled for the concession of this new right within the constitutional praxis.

TI Tensions in the configuration and reconfiguration of the mobilities and
   territorialities of street inhabitants in Bogota
SO REVISTA COLOMBIANA DE SOCIOLOGIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE cartography; mobilities; public space; street inhabitants;
   territorialities
AB The article analyzes the configuration and reconfiguration of mobilities and territorialities of street inhabitants in Bogota, amidst the tensions between the urban public space conceived by hegemonic knowledge/powers and built from the meanings, uses, and everyday experiences of the city. It proposes a two-stage reading of conceptual axes of the research, namely street inhabitants, territoriality, mobility, and public space. The first one in context shows the panorama of the mobilities and territorialities configuration based on the tension between a growing capital city and a process of fragmentation and compared to street territorialities. This goes from a relatively open and free relationship with public space to an ambivalent where the "pots" become a space of degradation but at the same time, a place that represents security in the face of indifference, persecution and "social cleansing". The second stage identifies the forms of reconfiguration of mobilities and territorialities of street inhabitants, after the intervention of the Bronx, on May 28, 2016.
   This research proposes a qualitative approach to identify the logic of the mobility of street inhabitants in Bogota during these stages, implementing a strategy of information collection with techniques as the documentary review of previous research on urban public space and the historical development of this population group; interviews with street inhabitants in different locations of the city; interview with a street care services operator; interview with an academic expert; ethnographic observation and analysis of figures from the 2007 and 2017 street population censuses. The findings prove that, although mobility constitutes a survival strategy for the street inhabitant mediated by needs and economic activities, practices, and links with the territory and its peers, it also responds to a fragmentation process and discontinuity in the city that creates enclaves of informality and conditions/limits such mobility. With this, transits and tensions between voluntary and involuntary mobility are identified.

AB The adoption and upbringing of children by parents of the same sex is a subject recently discussed in Colombia, even though it has been investigated for more than four decades in the rest of the world. There are concerns that growing up in this kind of family produces adverse effects. This document aims to respond through a review of the literature if there are differences between biological children or children adopted by homosexual parents in psychological adjustment, development of sexuality, stigmatization and cognitive performance. Through the search in the PubMed database, 204 articles were found in total, 18 articles were selected that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, which include approximately 1700 children with different types of families. In conclusion, the quality of the studies does not allow to generate degrees of recommendation for answering whether the welfare of these children is equal, better or worse than the children raised by heterosexual parents. However, a certain tendency and consistency among the studies shows that there is no difference in the psychological well-being or the development of sexuality between these two groups of families. In contrast, there is a greater possibility of stigmatization, a variable that does not depend itself on the conformation of the family or the sexual orientation of the parents, but depends on external factors such as the social and educational environment of the child and his peers.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of an inventory to measure the hegemonic masculinity in men residing in an intermediate city in Colombia. A sample of 600 participants between 18 to 65 years old were selected using a non-probabilistic sampling for availability (M = 29, SD = 10.7). A 30 items inventory that measure the adherence to the roles of hegemonic masculinity modified version MNRI-M was applied. Exploratory Factor Analysis EFA showed five factors that explain 64 % of the common variance. Confirmatory Factor Analysis CFA confirmed very good fit of this penta-factorial model in a reduced version of 17 items S-B x(2) = 343.29, gl = 109, NNFI = 0.97; CFI = 0.98. RMSEA = 0.06 IC95 % (0.053, 0.067). Internal consistency, Alpha and Omega coefficients, were between 0.70 and 0.79. Constructed roles of hegemonic masculinity discriminated adequately according to age, educational level, socioeconomic classification, and occupation. It is concluded that MNRI-M has adequate psychometric properties.

LA Spanish

DE Aluminum; water; risk; health; clarification
ID QUALITY
AB Introduction: aluminum is incorporated into water naturally and/or anthropically, health risk levels above 0,2 mg/l according to Colombian regulations. It can arise as an emerging contaminant when aluminum salt coagulants are used improperly in the clarification of drinking water.
   Objective: to evaluate air pollution for human consumption in the central region of Colombia, determine its potential origin and compliance with current regulations.
   Methodology: exploratory research, analysis of the presence of aluminum in raw water and treated during the period 2008-2018, by means of samples and laboratory tests, as well as the hydraulic evaluation and the operation of water treatment plants, in municipalities of Los departments of Tolima and Cundinamarca, central region of Colombia.
   Results: in more than 30% of the municipalities evaluated, the presence of aluminum in the water for human consumption was evidenced, above the maximum allowed by the current regulations. In several cases it was due to deficiencies in the treatment process where aluminum salts are used for coagulation, without adequate dosage as occurred in the municipality of Melgar, or due to high concentrations present in the water supply sources, such as the case of Magdalena river in the central region of Colombia.
   Conclusions: aluminum in water for human consumption is due to its presence in water sources and the product of hydraulic and operational deficiencies in the clarification process of treatment plants where aluminum sulfate is used as a coagulant, due to inadequate application of optimal doses, poor intensity of agitation and speed gradients in fast mixing and flocculation, flocculation and sedimentation times outside the optimal range.

AB This review article seeks to show the different challenges bioart generates in the scope of intellectual property, and therefore, the barriers bioart artists can find both in the search of protection for their works, and in the use of patented technologies while developing their creative processes. For this, the concepts and technics used in various bioart works created from the end of the twentieth century are analyzed in the scope of traditional intellectual property postulates, according to ACN regulations, and national and international jurisprudence and doctrine. Considering that bioart is the product of a complex relationship between art and science, this article is divided into two sections: the first section covers bioart in the scope of copyright, including non-protection of ideas, irrelevance of merit, and originality, intellectual creation, and fixation criteria; and the second section covers bioart in the scope of patent law, including eligibility, patentability requirements, and freedom to operate. It also covers bioethical discussions and their relationship with bioart.

AB For the present study, rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L. var. Israeli) samples of 6 and 24 months of transplanted were collected from organic crops located in the high Andean area of Colombia. They were submitted to extraction of essential oil by steam distillation in Prototype equipment made of stainless steel. These oils were analyzed using GC-MS, to determine the chemical components present in these samples and the relative proportion. In order to know the existence of variations in the composition of the oil obtained, simultaneous extractions were carried out in the laboratory with an equipment of the same characteristics but made of glass. These samples were analyzed by GC-MS and therefore, it was obtained that the oils extracted in the prototype are composed in greater amount by monoterpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes, contrary to those obtained in the laboratory, where most were oxygenated monoterpenes. Eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, camphor, beta-caryophyllene, bornyl acetate, camphene, beta-pinene, limonene, phellandrene and gamma-terpinene were the major compounds in all samples analyzed, but in oils extracted in the prototype for plants of 24 months, the majority compound was alpha-pinene, unlike the one obtained in the laboratory for the same sample, where the compound with the highest presence was Eucalyptol. As for camphor, beta-careophilene and bornyl acetate, showed a decrease in their presence in the oils extracted in the prototype in plants of 24 and 6 months, contrary to camphene, beta-pinene and limonene, that increased their relative concentration in the oils extracted in the prototype, showing differences in oils extracted in each of the study equipment.

By using legal sociology both the labor law and its application are approached from a documentary analysis methodology from Colombian labor reality as an academic input with regard to the protection and warranty of the freedom of association. The purpose is to conclude that this coexistence is a jurisprudence's outcome contrario sensu to international agreements of freedom of association.

AB The study investigates how Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay work in sex education in current national laws. The aim is to analyze whether the aforementioned countries follow parameters and recommendations defined in international treaties. Starting with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to more recent documents, education was treated as a priority in childhood and adolescence, with the purpose of promoting the development of the integral personality of the human being. This includes attention to the teaching of sexuality as a way to provide conditions for access to information, public health and personal, professional and economic growth. This turns the theme as a strategic action of human rights, with a bias to promote well-being, respect and citizenship through a healthy, safe and productive life.

The consumer, due to its special characteristics, can only be seen as an unsecured creditor ; Administrative Resolution 13895 granted consumers priority over those creditors with privilege and preference.

AB Teaching urban management should not be understood only in the context of pedagogy and processes developed in the classroom. It requires involving different representations transformed into theoretical and methodological developments of different social sciences disciplines that contribute to understanding the city from an economic, social, cultural, and environmental perspective. As a teaching object, urban management also requires the recognition of its possibility as a discipline and its projection as a field of knowledge in order to foster an interdisciplinary and public dialogue on decisions regarding the city and territory. Through a case study, this paper evidences urban management as a knowledge in its disciplinary transit, as well as its interdisciplinary potentialities in terms of the distribution of different languages, representations, methodologies, and problems for a public teaching about the city.

AB Introduction: In 2019, Colombian public universities had a suspension of activities that lasted more than four months and affected their academic life and emotional life, for this reason it is proposed through the analysis of Burnout Syndrome to analyze the level of anxiety in these young people. university students.
   Objectives: We sought to validate the stress levels through the dimensions of academic attrition in the students of these higher education centers.
   Methods: We review the studies carried out on the subject, in which it was evidenced that they focused on measuring the dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and lack of personal fulfillment at work, which are proposed in the 1981 study by Maslach and Jackson..is article takes up this methodology and presents the results of 276 applied surveys, which were examined by factor analysis on the items considered from the Maslach-Burnout survey.
   Results:.e results allow to validate the presence of the syndrome in the students and the effectiveness of the questionnaire, showing a higher level of exhaustion compared to the other dimensions considered in the syndrome.
   Conclusions:.ese results allow decisions to be made in the future about possible suspensions of the academic load that significantly affect young people and impact their mental health. Introducao: Em 2019, as universidades publicas colombianas tiveram uma suspensao de atividades que durou mais de quatro meses e afetou sua vida academica e emocional, por isso se propoe atraves da analise da Sindrome de Burnout analisar o nivel de ansiedade nestes jovens pessoas estudantes universitarios.

AB Cigarette butts are one of the most common waste worldwide. The toxic and non-biodegradable components make cigarette butts a hazardous waste and one of the causes of pollution. This paper presents some of the results of a study on the re-cycling cigarette butts in the manufacture of clay bricks. Four mixtures were made, these include a control clay brick, with a clay content of 100% (LADRICOL 0%) and three additional mixtures incorporating cigarette butts in different percentages by weight (LADRICOL 2.5%, LADRICOL 5.0% and LADRICOL 7.5%). The mixtures were fired at different temperatures and these were tested to determine the physical and mechanical properties of the bricks. The results showed that the samples incorporating 2.5% cigarette butts content and fired at 850 degrees C are in compliance with the standard normative for this type of product (NTC 4205-2). Furthermore, this brick can improve the environmental quality and can reduce energy consumption during firing, by 19.75%.

AB This paper reflects about the concept of populism and its impact on democracy and representative politics in Latin America, taking as context the premise of Ernesto Laclau in which he declares that populism is an empty meaning, a performative act that becomes a form of make politics in the region, from particular features that consolidate the phenomenon of populism, but analyzing the ideological and political action differences existing among the leaders in the region may seem populist. On that way, first we present a conceptual travel of the term of populism, people, and democracy and representation. After we make an analysis of populism in Latin America through three representative examples: the new left populism of Hugo Chavez and Rafael Correa; and the neopopulism of Alvaro Uribe Velez. The conclusion of this research is that populism has characteristic features that make a leader think as a populist, but it is not a homogeneous political theory, because within populism there are ideological differences, and aspects of the social, economic and political conditions of each context and country of the region.

DE Coagulation methods; Hevea brasiliensis latex; formic acid; citric acid
AB Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) is a crop widely grown in the Magdalena Medio region in Colombia. To obtain natural rubber, coagulants are used to solidify latex, being formic acid being the most used. However, coagulating substances have consequences in those who manipulate them and in the environment. In the present work, two extraction methods, one conventional (use of formic acid) and the other non-conventional (use of citric acid), were compared. Formic acid stood out for its speed, although it is more expensive than citric acid. The two methods generated sheets of similar elasticity. Citric acid, on the other hand, produced better results in elasticity and environmental impact; its use is recommended for the extraction of latex, for the Magdalena Medio region.

DE biological dimension; fragility; reciprocity; individual; respect
AB we analyze in this article the thesis of MacIntyre which supports the biological or animal dimension of the human being, as the privileged condition by which the vulnerable and dependent character of the moral agents can be recognized. This starting point allows to argue in favor of the virtues related to the reciprocity and to question the idea of the human being like a solitary individual, without affective and moral ties. We will see that this approach presents some difficulties that will be examined at the end of the text and that its position, although valuable, can not have priority over the modern conception of the individual.

AB Vascular wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum is the most damaging disease in cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana L.) production. In this study, we isolated and biochemically characterized endophytes and rhizospheric bacterial isolates with antagonistic activity against F. oxysporum from cape gooseberry plants. Bacterial isolates were evaluated under in vitro conditions for their antagonistic capacity against a highly virulent isolate of F. oxysporum, as well as production of lytic enzymes, biosurfactants and volatile organic compounds. Twenty-four antagonistic bacteria were selected, out of which Bacillus sp. MB015 and Pseudomonas sp. MB108 exhibited the best biocontrol activity in vitro, with inhibition levels of 80.6% and 79.9%, respectively. However, under greenhouse conditions, P. fluorescens MB103 and B. megaterium MB112 presented the best antagonistic capacity with 83.3% control of vascular wilt incidence. P. fluorescens MB103 was one of most effective in reducing the disease severity with an area under the disease of progress curve (AUDPC) of 7.5, compared with the negative control (soil infested with Fox17 without test bacteria), which presented an AUDPC of 36.8. These results suggest that P. fluorescens MB103 is a good candidate for use as a biocontrol agent against vascular wilt caused by F. oxysporum in cape gooseberry under field conditions.

AB Weeds are one of the phytosanitary problems that affect crop's productivity. The critical period of competition (PCC) allows to predict the level of interference of weeds on the crop. The objective of this investigation was to determine the PCC between carrot and weeds or other accompanying plants, in the municipality of Ventaquemada, department of Boyaca. A completely randomized blocks, with 12 treatments and four repetitions, was used. It included a group of treatments free of weeds for 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 days, at the end each the weeds growth was allowed, so that the crop was first free and then in competition (FC). The second group of treatments allowed the initial competition between weeds and the crop, for the same period of first group at the end of each time period the weeds were removed. The largest amount of carrots plants was obtained in the free weeds plot during 50 days after emergence. The highest yield was attained in the free weeds treatment throughout the crop cycle (5810g m-2). It was 2252 g higher than the production obtained at the critical point of competition. In general, the critical period of competition in carrot was thorough 20 to 45 days after crop emergence.

In the absence of studies associated with the impact of the UNIPEP on the peace building process in the country, the general objective of the article revolves around analyzing the organizational model of the UNIPEP, created to respond to the responsibilities of the implementation of the Peace Agreement. For the elaboration of the article, a qualitative methodology was used, of an exploratory nature, which included strategies such as the review of documents and semi-structured interviews, from which, strengths, weaknesses and opportunities of the UNIPEP organizational model were highlighted. Based on the theoretical and conceptual discussion presented in the first sections of the article, it is affirmed that the organizational evolution of the UNIPEP can be associated with the community model, due to the importance given to the participation of the community where it operates, its intent for having a decentralized structure, and its emphasis on prevention strategies.

AB Metformin used as a first-line drug to treat Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is transported via organic cation channels to soft tissues. Mutations in the SLC22A1 gene, such as Gly401Ser, Ser189Leu, and Arg206Cys, may affect the drug's therapeutic effect on these patients. This study aims at proposing a potential structural model for drug interactions with the hOCT1 transporter, as well as the impact of these mutations at both topological and electronic structure levels on the channel's surface, from a chemical point of view with, in addition to exploring the frequency distribution. To chemically understand metformin diffusion, we used an open model from the protein model database, with ID PM0080367, viewed through UCSF Chimera. The effect of the mutations was assessed using computational hybrid Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics, based on the Austin Model 1 semi-empirical method using Spartan 18' software. The results demonstrate coupling energy for metformin with amino acids F, W, H and Y, because of the interaction between the metformin dication and the electron cloud of pi orbitals. The mutations analyzed showed changes in the chemical polarity and topology of the structure. The proposed diffusion model is a possible approach to the interaction mechanism between metformin and its transporter, as well as the impacts of variants, suggesting structural changes in the action of the drug. Metformin efficacy considerably varies from one patient to another; this may be largely attributed to the presence of mutations on the SLC22A1 gene. This study aims at proposing a potential structural model for metformin-hOCT1 (SLC22A1) transporter interaction, as well as the identification of the effect of mutations G401S (rs34130495), S189L (rs34104736), and R206C (616C > T) of the SLC22A1 gene at the topological and electronic structure levels on the channel surfaces, from a chemical viewpoint. Our results demonstrated that the coupling energies for metformin with aromatic amino acids F, W, H and Y, because of the interaction between the metformin dication and the electron cloud of pi orbitals. Changes in the chemical environment's polarity and the structure's topology were reported in the mutations assessed. The diffusion model proposed is a potential approach for the mechanism of interaction of metformin with its transporter and the effects of variants on the efficacy of the drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The assessment of the frequency of these mutations in a sample of Colombian type 2 diabetes patients suggests that different SLC22A1 gene variants might be involved in reduced OCT1 activity in the Colombian population since none of these mutations were detected.

AB Introduction The SARS-Cov-2 infection has multiple neurologic manifestations including encephalitis in multiple cases reported, however the psychosis as principal manifestation of this condition is infrequently. Case Report We report the case of a 48-year-old woman with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 who developed paranoid and self-referential ideas with behavioural alteration and multiple findings on mental examination. Encephalitis associated with Covid-19 was suspected due to the neurological clinical presentation (persistent despite resolve hypoxaemia and systemic symptoms) and brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) that showed asymmetric hippocampal hyperintensities, although cerebrospinal fluid and electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal. The patient received medical treatment with methylprednisolone for 5 days with complete resolution of her symptoms. Discussion The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has neurological complications either by direct involvement or by para-infectious or post-infectious phenomena. Encephalitis occurs in a small proportion of the cases, while psychiatric symptoms have been described in a variable percentage of the events. However, a psychotic picture such as the one reported in our case is unusual. MRI, cerebrospinal fluid and EEG are important for the diagnostic evaluation of these patients but not obligatory to the diagnosis. The treatment of this condition with corticosteroids has been successful even in cases associated with Anti-NMDA. Our case is the second reported in Colombia, the first to be associated with psychosis.

AB This review aims to describe the prevalence of child malnutrition in different hospitals in Latin America and to identify some of the indicators associated with the deterioration of nutritional status. To achieve this, a systematic bibliographic research was made following the PRISMA methodology, for articles on the prevalence of child and adolescents malnutrition related to diseases in Latin American countries published between 1995 and January 2019. Studies reporting data on prevalence in malnourished hospitalized patients < 18 years with a sample size greater than 50 subjects were eligible for inclusion. The review was conducted by three independent reviewers who assessed methodological quality. As the main result, it was identified that the reported prevalence of malnutrition in hospitalized pediatric patients varies considerably. This figure ranged from 3,3 to 67%. The difference is mainly due to the diversity of populations assessed and the methods used to detect and assess nutritional status. As a main conclusion, the high variability reported in terms of evaluation of nutritional status raises the need for the unification of classification standards to favor decision-making at the hospital level.

AB Purpose: To compare the results obtained in decision-moment of two groups of students, based on the beer game, one from a private university and one from a public one. The decision-moment is explained by deliberate and emergent strategies.
   Design: A strategy workshop focused on decision-moment, based on a virtual application of the beer game in which participants were expected to generate deliberate strategies. After its conclusion, a survey determined how they would face the generation of emergent strategies. The results were then compared through Kruskal-Wallis' nonparametric test.
   Findings: We identified significant differences in the perception of workshop participants about decision-moment, in regards to rationality. There was no evidence of statistically significant differences in the remaining thirteen variables.
   Research limitations: This research looks at the perceptions of agents that were subject to a workshop-based situation. Although it provides valuable information for the understanding of this phenomenon, it is necessary to approach the actual context in the future.
   Contribution: To consolidate the results obtained previously in order to understand decision-moment behaviour, based on deliberate and emergent strategies.

This is a mixed-approach study, including information collected through a survey, validated by peers of experts, which researched aspects of the evaluation applied in an asynchronous modality virtual learning environment. An interpretative analysis was used for information processing. At a quantitative level, the reliability indicators principal component, analysis technique, was considered to determine the evaluation variables. The results indicate that traditional assessment prevails, but changes in its foundation and implementation are needed. Four variables were identified: routine assessment, crisis routine assessment, continuous and formative assessment, and evaluation with technological resources. The main conclusion is that the situation forced by the pandemic in education has challenged evaluation control, which generates a reflection to the group of teachers on this matter.

AB Using simultaneous thermogravimetrical analysis coupled with mass spectroscopy, the pyrolysis of African palm husk, using several heat rates and programs was performed. Seven relations of mass/charge were followed of the evolved gas of the pyrolysis process, fitting the kinetics and the mass spectroscopy signals to the distributed activation energy model (DAEM) with different numbers of pseudo-components. Fitting with four pseudo-components proved to be the best for modeling the thermal degradation process. Kinetic parameters were not affected by the heating rate or program employed, which agrees with other reports for similar biomass. Methane, methanol formaldehyde, furfural were successfully fitted to the DAEM model, nevertheless CO2 and NO2 were not able to be represented by this model due to its production in secondary reactions in gaseous phase.

DE Eosinophilic cholecystitis; Children; Cholecystitis
AB Introduction: Eosinophilic cholecystitis (EC) is rarely seen in the pediatric population. Most of the available literature comes from adult patients, while only anecdotal cases have been reported in children.
   Objective: To describe the clinical course, management, and outcomes of all EC cases treated at a children's hospital.
   Material and methods: All cholecystectomy specimens obtained between 2011 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. EC was diagnosed when more than 90% of the inflammatory cells in the gallbladder wall were eosinophils, whereas lymphoeosinophilic cholecystitis (LEC) was diagnosed when the percentage of eosinophils was between 50 and 90. We analyzed all dinical aspects of patients with EC and LEC.
   Results: We identified and reviewed 134 cholecystectomy specimens. Of them, 8 (6.0%) were classified as EC, and 3 (2.2%) as LEC. The mean age at presentation was 12.6 (2-17) years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.5/1. One patient had a history of hereditary spherocytosis, and 3 patients had systemic eosinophilia. All patients presented with dinical and radiological signs of acute cholecystitis and underwent cholecystectomy. Acute cholecystitis was confirmed by histopathology in all cases. All cases of EC and LEC had cholelithiasis. None of the patients required additional treatment. All patients recovered uneventfully.
   Conclusions: EC is rarely seen in children, it does not have a specific clinical presentation, and it is always associated with cholelithiasis. The diagnosis is made postoperatively by histopathology. All patients in our study presented with acute cholecystitis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Technology applied to the use of big data has been an important tool to provide necessary information for public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Colombia has not been the exception. In this document, we analyze two data inputs (digital contact tracking and aggregate mobility analysis, both based on cell phone data), based on which public health measures have been taken in the Latin American country, such as, for example, determining differential control zones within a city, contact tracking, and identification of potential super spreaders. Based on a sample of the data used, we reflect upon the findings reported so far, especially from the perspective of complex networks of contacts and super spreaders, which have been shown to have a critical role in the behavior of the epidemic. The analyses shown here are part of a complex interaction of political and epidemiological contexts which have led to diverse implementations. We highlight that several examples of public policies in Colombia have been informed by this data.

AB This article approaches the situations of exclusion and segregation derived from public housing policy in Bogota, particularly in the Ciudadela Nuevo Usme (UPZ 61 in the town of Usme), identified in the solidarity extension project "Usmeando" the right to city and land use in the post-conflict period, which led the Research Group "Urban Processes in Habitat, Housing and Information" of the National University of Colombia, in association with the social and community process of the Usme Popular Public Hearing in 2017.
   This aproximacion arises from the approach to the realities and territorial conflicts, as well as from a joint look between the organized community and inhabitant of UPZ 61, and the researchers. For this, research, action and community participation instruments were used, which allowed the development of strategies to tackle problems related to the inhabited territory.
   In short, this document contains critical reflections on the issues related to the territory and the daily life of inhabiting this place (housing without a city), and the challenges that emerge from it. It also addresses the limitations for the construction of the social fabric; the social management of the urban and its conflicts; the results of said management from the perspective of the conceived to the lived; and the potential of the experience.

AB A methodology to define rainfall-landslide thresholds, using a probabilistic model in which the accumulated rainfall at any time is treated as a random variable, is proposed. The region under study is divided into areas of homogeneous rain hazard. For each homogeneous area, a probability model is fitted using state-of-the-art statistical methods, for each accumulation time considered. Thresholds are obtained by the definition of confidence intervals. Instantaneous accumulated rains, measured in real-time, are used to calculate the instantaneous probabilities of a landslide at each area and accumulation time. The maximum instantaneous probability determines the critical accumulated rain and sets the issued warning level. In addition, the model is tested, retrospectively, with the data for the disaster of April 19, 2017, in Manizales, Colombia, where 38 rainfall-triggered landslides killed 17 people and affected more than 3126 families.

DE Self-regulation; co-regulation; sources; lex informatica
AB Objective: The scarce normative developments at the international level and the initiatives related to the harmonization of the law in the electronic field, make necessary its singular legal discipline. The purpose of this paper is to identify the sources of the so-called lex informatica.
   Methodology: The study starts with the definition of lex informatica, then focuses on the alternative forms of regulation applied to computer law and ends with the systematization of the categories on which this new discipline could be built.
   Conclusion: The research leads to the conclusion that, in view of the need for an appropriate regulation, the possibility of public and private entities interacting through the co-regulation scheme in the consolidation of this normative body should be explored, and that while this is happening, the custom and general principles of law should continue to be used for its development.

AB in this work a multivariable optimal PID controller for a continuous stirred tank reactor was designed in order to obtain optimal system performance without decoupling. The tuning of this controller is obtained by using an evolutionary algorithm (MAGO). This solution is compared with classical methods for multivariable control. The results of this study showed that the controller designed rejects the effect of disturbances and follows the external reference signal efficiently. Evolutionary tuning overcomes broadly the classical methods.

DE Contract for the Provision of Services; Labor Relationship; Primacy of
   the Substance over the From; Tax Burdens; Social Benefits
AB Colombian judges agree to grant benefits to individuals who demonstrate that the contract for the provision of professional services with the Administration was in reality a subordinate labor relationship. However, this recognition could become unfair when judges do not consider the tax burden of the apparent service provider. This research paper aims to show that, in those cases where the primacy of the substance over the form is declared, the taxes paid by the service provider were collected without a proper taxable source: the denaturalized contract for the provision of services.

AB This document presents an analysis in the development of a new mathematical formulation with which it will be possible to determine, through probabilistic approaches, the cost that can be generated if a diversified electricity market existed, in which the demand is able to actively participate. For this, it is considered that the electrical demand in a moment of time has associated a probability distribution and a system that makes it controllable. The cost of uncertainty of demand is mathematically developed by calculating the expected cost of supplying the most convenient demand value for the power system. The validation of the analytical formula is done through the Monte Carlo method, which allows us to compare the penalty costs in the case of underestimating or overestimating the demand for electrical energy.

DE Tropical soil; volcanic rock; geotechnical characterization
AB Introduction- Soils found in tropical zones, as they are subject to factors that favour the chemical meteorisation process, tend to have particular geotechnical properties as opposed to those found in temperate zones. Fundamental aspects such as the degree of meteorization and genesis of the material, which tend to influence soil properties, are not taken into account by the methodologies intended to study the characteristics of these soils. Consequently, they are insufficient, requiring complementary procedures for an adequate description of the geotechnical characteristics of the material.
   Objective- To propose a methodology for the characterization of a tropical soil derived from volcanic rocks. This is an attempt to adequately describe this type of soil and extrapolate it to soils of tropical regions derived from different rocks. For this purpose, a tropical soil located on a slope southwest of the municipality of Caldas in Antioquia (Colombia) was taken as a case study.
   Methodology- An experimental program was developed to evaluate the physical, chemical, mineralogical and hydro-mechanical properties of the material in the study area.
   Results- It was found that the relationship between the degree of weathering and the genesis of the material have an influence on the geotechnical properties evaluated.
   Conclusions- With this methodological proposal it was possible to evaluate important aspects such as the degree of meteorization and genesis of the material, obtaining not only basic geotechnical parameters for the analysis, design and execution of civil projects but also a better description of the material.

AB The Territorial Spaces for Training and Reincorporation (ETCR) as settlements for demobilized FARC-EP members and their reintegration into civilian life, in the framework of the Peace Agreement signed in 2016 between the government of Colombia and this insurgent group, stand out for the self-management and self-construction of these villages of the future, by the former combatants as discrete actors, with varying degrees of spatial consolidation, from a collective intelligence that has been building its habitat in the jungle for half a century. An examination of the urbanization process of the ETCR Las Colinas, Department of Guaviare, and comparison with documents associated with the Peace Agreement, makes it possible to establish the territorial elements that make it possible for these settlements to be reincorporated into the host communities. It is noted that ex-combatants face a sense of uncertainty as a result of continuous pressure from various actors to make the TRCs disappear, which motivates their inhabitants to accelerate the production of their habitat in their interest to remain.

AB This document has as main objective to identify the macroeconomic determinants that influence the returns of the portfolios in the financial markets of the countries that are part of the Pacific Alliance, for the years between 2009 and 2015. Thus, it is intended to establish if the arbitration pricing theory (APT) postulated by Ross (1976), applies to the portfolios of the Alliance's stock markets. The portfolios were constructed based on the methodology proposed by Fama and French (1996). The study concludes in empirical terms that the APT model does not apply to the financial markets of the Pacific Alliance countries.

AB This article reports on a descriptive study carried out in articles published in the Profile: Issues in Teachers' Professional Development journal that deal with inclusive education in English language teaching in Colombia. The study embraced documentary research and critical discourse analysis which helped us identify trends in pedagogical approaches in foreign language instruction and research approaches employed by the journal's authors. It also allowed us to examine how such approaches show the presence or absence of inclusive education both in public policies and pedagogical interventions by institutions and individuals. We hope that the outcomes derived from this study nurture further discussion, encourage research, and motivate pedagogical practices that foster inclusive education in foreign language teaching and teacher education.

AB The failure of the war on drugs during the last decades in Colombia, the rise in the levels of consumption and the relative tendency of some countries to legalize certain substances, make it relevant to deepen the analysis, on public policies designed to confront such phenomenon, from non-traditional perspectives. In this sense, this article uses the Advocacy Coalition Framework to determine how the systems of beliefs have influenced the design and development of the policy on drugs in Colombia. The period of analysis begins in 2000, when Plan Colombia was first implemented, until 2015, when the third phase of that Plan was completed. This study uses document analysis as its main method of data collection, focusing especially on speeches performed by the relevant actors within the subsystem of the drug policy in Colombia.

AB The combined effect of tire wastes and microspheres as substitutes of the raw material used in the conventional process of concrete making was explored in this study. Mixes of conventional concretes with modifications of 15% in mass of fine additions of tire wastes and glass microspheres of 0:1, 1:1, 1:3, 3:1 and 1:0 were designed and prepared. Cylindrical samples of 150mmx300mm were made from such mixes. The evaluation of the mechanical and physical properties of the cylindrical samples made evident that the materials with the higher content of tires wastes presented lower densities, whereas the ones with a higher content of microspheres showed higher compression resistance; in fact, the 0:1, and 1:3 mixes showed resistance to compression values of 22.4 and 19.1 MPa, respectively. The results found showed that the joint addition of microspheres and tire wastes presented a synergic effect between the two materials with a potential use in the construction sector, substituting traditional materials used in concretes production. Particularly, it is expected that the use of such materials becomes an alternative to the use of these wastes, which do not have a waste arrangement nowadays.

DE Digitized RoF (DRoF); Dynamic Range; NG-PON2; CRAN; VCSEL
ID C-RAN; TRANSMISSION; FRONTHAUL
AB Introduction- The impact of the digitalization process on the performance of a scenario based on Radio-on-Fiber technology at intermediate frequency is numerically assessed.
   Objective- Assess the impact of the process of digitalization, in the performance of scenario Radio-over-fiber digitized intermediate frequency (IF-DRoF).
   Methodology- The performance of an IF-DRoF system against the error is evaluated as a function of the link distance and the number of resolution bits of the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), and the results are compared with the analog Radio-over-Fiber (ARoF) architecture. The DRoF scenario introduces an ADC at the transmitter to digitize the signals, and a Digital-to-Analog converter (DAC) at the receiver to reconstruct them. The optical transmitter uses a low cost Directly Modulated Vertical Cavity Emitting Laser (DM-VCSEL).
   Results- IF-DRoF scenario extends the transmission distance by 18 km (from 25 up to 48 km), and 22 km (from 25 up to 47 km) using an ADC with 4 and 8 bit of resolution, respectively, when compared to ARoF. Also, for a bit error rate (BER) equal to 10(-9), the IF-DRoF system increases the range by 7 km, and the bit rate scales as the product number of resolution bits of the ADC x sampling rate (8 x 1.25 Gb/s = 10 Gb/s). The sensitivity level measured at the receiver for a maximum range of 42 km was -21 dBm for a BER of 10(-5)@ 4 bits of resolution.
   Conclusions- IF-DRoF system is a flexible and low-cost solution that extends the transmission distance and scales with bitrate as n bits x sampling rate comparing with analog RoF. It is shown that the dynamic range is independent of the transmission distance except when the signal level falls below the sensitivity of the optical link photodetector.

AB Through the presentation of the history of social justice in global constitutional discourse, this article aims to demonstrate that, although in Colombia there is not a constitutionalized purpose or principle of social justice, as in other countries, the modern notion of distributive justice, also called social justice today, is implicit in the Constitution of 1991 because it enshrined as mandatory rules the three main elements of its meaning at the time of its promulgation: the principle of social rule of law, the principle of human dignity and the right to a material equality. Thus, in Colombia social justice must not be understood in the Aristotelian sense of distributive justice but in accordance with these three elements, and can only be achieved if they are fulfilled.

AB This paper analyzes the configuration of the Colombian political regime during the government of Alvaro Uribe Velez (2002-2010) from the theoretical perspective of electoral authoritarianism. He argues that in this period there was a drift towards electoral authoritarianism, since the government deployed eroded the independent powers for the benefit of the Executive one, incurred practices of electoral manipulation, illegal repression of opposition agents and implemented a communication strategy aimed at producing opacity. However, this authoritarian tendency failed to consolidate at the level of the political regime, because in 2010 was prevented a second re-election of Uribe and gave way to alternation in government.

SO PERSPECTIVA GEOGRAFICA

DT Article
DE City; places; memory; territory; women
AB The present article describes how women of La Avanzada and Carpinelo, neighborhoods of Medellin, have appropriated places within them, that evoke fear and memory. The article answers the questions: What are the places of fear and memory for women, what perceptions do they have and how do they appropriate them? The argumentation weaves the relationship between gender and territory from two approaches: culture and feminist geography. The methodological included tours of the places, elaboration of social cartographies and group and individual interviews. The results show how fear and insecurity that women feel in some places of their neighborhoods, have been creating boundaries that prevent its uses. These factors have limited the appropriation of those places by the community, restricting liberty and autonomy, crucial factors to the foundation of a city perceived safe for women.

SO ANALECTA POLITICA

DT Article
DE Urban areas; local government; nation-state; metropolis; power
AB In recent decades, the death of the nation-state has been announced, opening the door to the idea of a world that manages to overcome government, justice, economic redistribution, social integration and territorial control issues. After 2010, the idea of the disappearance of the nation-state has grown again, where there is a consensus on the need to recognize the leading role that cities currently play, and how they concentrate the conditions of power over which states can act. In this context, the aim of this paper is to inquire what metropolises represent with respect to contemporary nation-states. This question was resolved based on the review of texts written by experts, data derived from specialized journals and a review of specific news published in international newspapers. In conclusion, the nation-states see in the big cities, on the one hand, an opportunity to strengthen their political power in an unprecedented way; or on the contrary, a challenge to their power, understood as a permanent tension between urban areas and state government, seen as the subjection of the metropolis to the States.

AB We study a particular set of chemical reaction networks related to the emergence of homochirality. Each element of this set is a chemical reaction mechanism intended to produce homochirality. Those mechanisms contains a pair of enantiomers, the central subject of this study, which are involved in a series of reactions that produce and consume them. The other species concentrations are considered constant. The reactions of each mechanism are arranged into six categories, that we have called synthesis, first order decomposition, autocatalytic, second order decomposition, non-enantioselective and inhibition reactions. The reaction networks must satisfy a symmetry constraint that is related to the kinetic and thermodynamic indiscernibility of the isomers. We investigate the emergence of homochirality phenomena in those networks. To this end, we introduce a mathematical notion of homochiral states that we call Frank states, and which seems to be deeply related to the occurrence of homochiral dynamics. We find sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of Frank states, and we use those results to develop an algorithmic tool. This tool can be used to recognize networks admitting homochiral states, and in given case, it can also be used to construct Rank states of the input-network. We test the mathematical machinery, and the aforementioned algorithm, analyzing the well-established models of Rank and Kondepudi-Nelson. We were able to show that those two networks admit homochiral dynamics. We use our tools to analyze three further network models derived from the Kondepudi-Nelson model and which were adapted to the Strecker synthesis of amino acids.

DE community; education; peace building; case study
AB Peace is built upon actions that generate well-being, and education is conceived as one of the main activities through which welfare and new opportunities are created for people. Based on this premise, priest German Chaves from the Santa Agueda church has managed and directed a training process thought to improve the lives of community members by offering high quality and no cost education, including 34 academic projects involving courses, seminars, and certification programs, in a four year period, with a total of 2193 persons attending these courses.
   This article presents a case study of in the Santa Agueda community parish, an active subject that frames peace-building actions under community initiatives. The first section explains why a case study is applied to the understanding of this specific situation. Then, the authors examine theories about peace building that support the actions undertaken in the Santa Agueda parish. The third section presents the perception of the beneficiaries regarding these activities. Finally, the data and appreciations collected during field work in the parish are analyzed.

AB Background/AimDental trauma in school populations has a high frequency and school teachers are often close to the place where such injuries occur. However, many studies have confirmed the lack of knowledge as to how to act in these cases. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge in regard to dental trauma of school teachers in Colombia.
   Materials and MethodsA multicentre, descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in 251 schools using a stratified randomized sampling. A structured hard copy survey was personally delivered to 2390 school teachers in the selected schools. The survey contained questions related to work experience, teaching level and demographic data, as well as questions related to their knowledge of and attitude towards emergency dental trauma management.
   ResultsThe response rate was 96%. Most of the school teachers (95%) had never received training related to dental trauma, although 35% had witnessed at least 1 case. Of 2296 school teachers surveyed, only 5.8% would have replanted an avulsed tooth. An association was found between work experience and appropriate management of an avulsed tooth. No significant differences were found in regard to school location (city), school type (private/public), gender and school teachers' education level.
   ConclusionsThe knowledge of school teachers in Colombia about emergency dental trauma management is inadequate. The findings strongly suggest a need for an education strategy with the involvement of the government, dentistry schools and private organizations.

AB This article presents a case study on how dairy producers and a university are connected to generate territorial development in a municipality. The field of study along with in-depth semi-structured interviews showed that university knowledge reaches dairy farmers through weak ties and imitating production processes. This relationship makes it possible to show that the knowledge produced in academia reaches producers, even though there is no deliberate plan to bring these two local development actors together. This case study allows us to better understand local actors and the manner in which they can generate development in an area.

DE Kriol; ecolinguistics; linguistic education; sociolinguistics;
   linguistic documentation; San Andres and Providence; language shift
AB The state of vitality of Kriol in San Andres, Providence and Saint Kathleen has been a subject of profound discussion. Although amongst the Raizal ethnic community of the islands it is vital, and it has been raised as an identity symbol by a large part of its speakers, studies indicate there is a trend of language shift towards Spanish, the dominant language of domains such as administration and trade. This article seeks to complement this discussion by presenting related academic reflections, research efforts and work with the community that its authors have held from three fundamental fields of action: linguistic education, sociolinguistics, and linguistic documentation. It is concluded that, although State support in terms of linguistic policies has been insufficient, members of the community themselves have led and participated in actions geared towards keeping their language alive, obtaining meaningful advances, even if the road to tread is still a long one.

AB The concept of "good business practices" is commonly used in the business world. In the field of transportation, although the discussion is not new, recent guidelines issued by the Colombian authorities allow for the discussion to be considered once again as to the legal implications that said practices may have. This article addresses the legal issues related to the adoption of these practices by first introducing the concept of "good business practice" and its evolution. Then it reviews some of the implications that the authors consider that the concept may have from a legal perspective.

AB Education, as an instrument that improves the quality of life, is tied to the socioeconomic dynamics in which people live. This will determine the processes of entry and permanence in the school system and the subsequent training of human capital. This paper analyzes this relationship for Colombian rural areas in elementary and secondary education, through literature review, characterization of the rural environment and the evaluation of public policies for the 2006-2016 period as a contributing tool to the educational reach of rural habitants. It is concluded that this link between socioeconomic origin and educational achievement still marks significant differences between urban and rural population in the country. Efforts are required by the public sector to promote education as a life transforming agent.

TI ROLE OF INFLAMMASOME IN THE GENESIS OF HEAD AND NECK CANCER
SO MORFOLIA
LA Spanish
DT Review
DE Inflamasomes; Carcinoma; Head and neck neoplasm; Cell death
ID ACTIVATION
AB Inflammation is a multistemic response to external or internal stimuli that lead to a biochemical response for repair. Chronic inflammation modifies the expression of proteins and DNA causing diseases such as cancer. PAMPs and DAMPs act as exogenous and endogenous signaling patterns in infection-related microenvironments. These signaling mechanisms are effectors of inflammation activation. This intracellular multiproteic complex has inflammation recognition patterns and promotes caspase-1 activation, which induce the activation of cytokines IL-1B and IL-18. The formation of NLRP3, ASC and procaspase-1 proteins is required for inflammation activation. In cancer, inflammations facilitate mood immunity by inducing oncogenic factors. This association has to do with the action of IL-1b. In squamous cell carcinoma the expression of components such as NLPR3, ASC, IL 1b and caspasa-1 is increased and marks a specific distribution in oropharynx tissue. The role of the NLRP3 protein has been the most studied as responsible for the process of oligomerization of inflammation, high levels of expression in epithelial tissue and in the development of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. It has also been associated with the activation of inflammation in the tumor tissue of squamous cell carcinoma of nasopharynx.

ID ATTACHMENT POINT THEORY; FRESH-WATER ALGAE; DISPERSAL; RIVER
AB Few studies have explored the ecology and interrelationship with other organisms of the many endangered freshwater turtle species inhabiting the Neotropical region. The focus of the current study was to shed light on the relationship between Neotropical turtle carapaces and primary producers, insofar as the surface of fonner constitutes a suitable substrate for the colonization and establishment of the latter. The under-explored relationship between turtle carapaces and the diatom assemblages inhabiting them was investigated and characterized in terms of taxonomic and biological traits (bio-volume, life-form, and attachment). The carapaces of seven native turtle species were surveyed. Among these carapaces, a total of 45 diatom taxa were found, and diatom taxa varied among turtle species. Podocnemis vogli and Podocnemis expansa supported more diverse diatom assemblages than Podocnemis lewyana, Rhinoclemmys diademata, and Rhinoclemmys melanosterna, which were dominated by Navicula spp. Analysis, further showed that carapace size did not explain differences in diatom diversity. Ilowever, a trait-based analysis suggests that both carapace roughness and an assemblage's successional stage might explain the differences in assemblage composition. Because turtles can serve as dispersal vectors, characterizing their epibiont diatom assemblages may contribute to our understanding of diatom distribution on larger scales, as well as, give us some clues as to the auto-ecology of turtles that help us to effectively determine conservation areas for these endangered species.

AB The structural isolation of nutrition from the human right to food has resulted in the technicalization and medicalization of the meaning and practice of nutrition, including in the field of nutritional assessments, which has led to the construction of public policies that lack a holistic perspective with a rights-based approach. Two main categories of nutritional assessments have been anthropometric measurements and nutritional profiles evident in the WHO and PAHO proposals related to the nutrition of children. In this paper, we present a critical discussion on the production and uses of both instruments in the evaluation of the growth and development of children and in the generation of global recommendations in public health with the objective of proposing alternatives for the measurement of malnutrition in communities affected by violations of the human right to food and nutrition. Our approach focuses on the construction not only based on the calorie-energy needs of the human body but also on food as a social, cultural and political process. It thus becomes an invitation to rethink nutrition from the notion of right to food to the implementation of research from participatory action.

AB Liberalism arises in the furrows of modern history and can be traced to the experience of the late-medieval commercial cities. It redesigns the modern terms of "republic" and "right" with their ideal of freedom (personal and collective), and exhibits a strong internationalist vocation. The paper explores the profiles of three great liberal thinkers in the field of international law and cooperation institutions, such as Immanuel Kant, Hans Kelsen and John Rawls. It uses a qualitative methodology and technique of documentary analysis technique. It is concluded that liberalism, as an idealist doctrine, recognizes that people not only compete with each other, but are also able to collaborate to achieve common goals, as an alternative that is not only more economic, but above all, more civilized.

AB We estimate the impact on female labor outcomes of the extension in maternity leave period from 12 to 14 weeks, an amendment to the Colombian labor law in 2011. To identify this impact, we compare labor market outcomes of different groups of individuals with women of child-bearing age. First we compared two groups of women with different fertility rates (low elasticity of substitution), finding that, as result of the extension, women in the high-fertility age group experience an increase in inactivity, informality, and self-employment. When comparing high-fertility age women with men in the same age group (high elasticity of substitution), we find that the extension increases the probability of unemployment, informality and self-employment and decreases wages of women compared with men.

AB Culpability, in being a dogmatic category and a principle of criminal law legitimation, enables it to be humanised and consequently applied in the human societies.
   This paper provides an overview of the evolution of culpability as a dogmatic category, from its early manifestations in the xix century until the end of the xx century.
   Furthermore, the aforementioned category is examined facing some extralegal considerations about the human behavior that have been worked out in the first years of the ongoing century, such as the recent approach about the individuals' freedom capacity that Neuroscience has brought to discussion.
   Thus, the concept of socio-cultural homeostasis is displayed in order to understand culpability as an essential but complex aspect of criminal law that justifies its aim of preserving the social order.

AB Bulb onion, an important product in the diet of Colombians, has an annual production of approximately 53,497 tons in Cundinamarca; after harvesting it is necessary to eliminate pseudostems and roots, by means of a procedure called "espatado". Within the subproject "Technologies and design or redesign of products that support the logistics operation system and distribution and development of a model in Bogota and Cundinamarca", the need to develop a topping formal tool for bulb onion that responds not only to improve the effectiveness of the process and ergonomic conditions, but also reduce the risk of accidents at work allowing an adequate handling of the product that results in its quality was evident. For the design of this tool, the disciplines of agricultural engineering and industrial design were integrated. The methodology of the process included the identification of referents and determinants, definition of a concept and the construction of an initial model validated in the field. It was linked to the final design of the tool, the feedback of the producers in order to give an integral response to their needs. The use of the tool reduced the time to perform the task, going from 27.75 to 31.5 onions/minute, improved grip, facilitated the completion of the task, improved posture and decreased the risk of physical damage to the product.

TI Chronic Kidney Disease Progression and Transition Probabilities in a
   Large Preventive Cohort in Colombia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEPHROLOGY

ID BLOOD-PRESSURE GOAL; VARIABILITY; POPULATION
AB Background. Variability in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression is a well-known phenomenon that underlines the importance of characterizing the said outcome in specific populations. Our objectives were to evaluate changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time and determine the frequency of dialysis admission and factors associated with this outcome, to estimate the rate of program's loss-to-follow-up and the probability of transition between CKD stages over time. Methods. The study type was an observational analytic retrospective cohort in patients treated in a CKD prevention program in Bogota, Colombia, between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013, with follow-up until December 31, 2018. Adult participants of 18 years of age or older with diagnosed CKD stages G3 or G4 were enrolled into a prevention program. For each patient, the rate of progression of CKD in ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year was estimated using the ordinary least-squares method. Dialysis initiation and program's loss-to-follow-up rates were calculated. Heat maps were used to present probabilities of transitioning between various CKD stages over time. Survival model with competing risks was used to evaluate factors associated with dialysis initiation. Results. A total of 2752 patients met inclusion criteria and contributed with 14133 patient-years of follow-up and 200 dialysis initiation events, which represents a rate of 1.4 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI 1.2 to 1.6). The median change of the eGFR for the entire cohort was -0.47 ml/min/1.73 m(2) per year, and in the diabetic population, it was -1.55 ml/min/1.73 m(2) per year. The program's loss-to-follow-up rate was 2.6 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI 2.3 to 2.9). Probabilities of CKD stage transitions are presented in heat maps. Female sex, older age, baseline eGFR, and serum albumin were associated with lower risk of dialysis initiation while CKD etiology diabetes, cardiovascular disease history, systolic blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, and LDL cholesterol were associated with a higher likelihood of dialysis initiation. Conclusions. A CKD secondary prevention program's key indicator is reported here, such as dialysis initiation, progression rate, and program drop-out; CKD progression appears to be correlated with diabetic status and timing of referral into the preventive program.

SO HISTORIA Y MEMORIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Professionalisation; medicine; deontology; Colombia; 19th century
AB In Colombia, the history of professionalisation is a little explored issue. The social history of the sciences and the sociology of the professions constitute a basis from which to examine it. This article poses two questions as a starting point: What are the relationships and confrontations between the medical profession and its related fields and how have they operated in the historical process of the professionalisation of medicine? How has the ethical discourse been manifested and how has it influenced this process? In order to illustrate the legitimisation of the monopoly of the practice of medicine in Colombia, a corpus of speeches and debates on its professionalization was established, with an emphasis on statements regarding ethics as a defence of the profession. Those discourses were published in the main medical and pharmacy journals of the country, between 1894 and 1914. The corpus shows that the medical arguments in favour of a monopoly on the practice of medicine, in addition to being scientific and economic, are political and ethical. They include argumentation in which are combined reflections on the moral qualities of doctors, as well as their legitimacy in the administration of the truth and the necessity to exert power in the delimitation of the profession.

DT Article
DE Individual capitalization; Real returns; Pensions; social security
AB On the performance of the private pensions system in Colombia, Individual Savings Regime with Solidarity - RAIs (per its acronym in Spanish), the results are often highlighted in terms of profitability; a thesis upheld by the fund Managers industry. In order to evaluate how significant the real returns generated by this scheme have actually been, from a database of daily transactions by the pension funds from 1995 to December 2016, and using the methodology established by the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia (SFC-Financial Superintendence of Colombia) for the calculation of returns, was determined the net return on explicit administration costs to be borne by the members and inflation adjustment. Such endeavor found that for the moderate, fund since they began operating, their actual profitability from the perspective of their affiliates has been close to zero, as has been the trend for conservative and higher risk funds, which in recent years tended to become negative. Based on these results, we discuss the benefits that are usually attributed to individual capitalization systems in terms of high returns, better pensions, and savings protection, which contrast with the low pensions, or impossibility attaining one, that is starting to become evident in private pension funds in Colombia.

AB The transdiagnostic model is based on the evaluation and treatment of the etiological and maintaining variables of mental disorders. The objective was to establish the relationship between the transdiagnostic variables: perfectionism, rumination, positive and negative affect, anxiety sensitivity and intolerance of uncertainty, and, on the other hand, stress, anxiety and depression. 333 adult participants convened by a non-probabilistic incidental sampling, whose ages ranged from 18 to 70 years old (M= 28, SD= 8.70), 37.40% were men and 62.54%, women, single (66.27%), mainly university students (65.57%). The study was a cross-sectional predictive non-experimental study. The results showed significant correlations between anxiety and depression, as well as between intolerance of uncertainty and perfectionism, and depression with positive and negative affect and perfectionism. Regarding stress, significant correlations were found between rumination and emotional style. The predictive model emphasized intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety sensitivity and positive and negative affect to predict anxiety (r(2) = .43), depression (r(2) = .37) and stress (r(2) = .17). It was concluded that the results provide evidence for the transdiagnostic model for anxiety and depression and, to a lesser extent, for stress.

AB It is presented an alternative biological method based on biomineralization mechanisms of Magnetotactic Bacteria (MTB) for the removal in groundwater, of soluble elements such as Fe+2 and Mn+2. In first place, it was compared the effectiveness of MTB retention methods for obtention of concentrated volumes in microorganisms, then, it was carried out an inoculation process in groundwater samples and evaluate the removal rate of Fe+2 and Mn+2 in constant conditions of pH and temperature. It was identified electromagnetic method is more efficient in MTB retention, and that the inoculation processes of an enriched solution with MTB in groundwater samples allow to get average removal rates of 47.86% for Fe+2 and 15.26% for Mn+2. In addition, it was evaluated the removal rate of other metals due to magnetic properties of biominerals inside of MTB magneto-some. The highest removal in all cases occurred between the interval of 3 and 5 min of interaction and tended to stabilize in time.

AB This document presents the process of design, development and evaluation of a digital educational resource for first semester students of Management Information Systems of the National University of Colombia, Manizales. This undergraduate curricular program works in an interdisciplinary area of knowledge that is related to administration and information technology. The content of the digital educational resource is based on the professional profile of this discipline, the basic concepts of General Theory of Systems and Systemic Thinking. The elements of the resource were designed by the teachers of the course and adapted to digital format by specialized professionals. The resource was consulted and used by students of the course, who through a survey evaluated each of its elements and the impact on their learning. The results show that the digital educational resource gave support to the topics studied in classroom and to the knowledge about the basic concepts of this interdiscipline. The students evaluated very positively the conceptual maps, the slides and the concepts related to the General Theory of Systems. It is proposed that future versions of this resource integrate the results of the activities indicated in the resource and developed for the students.

AB Nursing job satisfaction establishes the quality of the services provided. When determining this in hospital settings as intensive care units and Primary Health Care in the community, through the self-report of 280 nurses with the application of Font Roja questionnaire of 24 items, it is found that 39.6% of the population is between 20 and 30 years old, where the community environment has higher and statistically significant averages (p=0.00) in the interpersonal relationship with their heads and colleagues, perceptions that favor the autonomy of the nursing professional. The hospital environment enjoys greater satisfaction with work, in the same way, it is better satisfied with professional competence. The labor monotony that manifests the scarce variety of work is self-reported with a higher average in the community environment, and affirmed with an OR of 2.36 (p = 0.00), considering it a risk factor for this. To conclude, comparative job satisfaction in two work environments ratifies a reality of the dissatisfaction of interpersonal relationships with colleagues and heads of the hospital environment and monotony as a risk factor in community environments.

AB This research covers an interpretation of the successes and failures of the adult learning theory (andragogy) in teacher training in the use of ICT's for developing technological skills. A case study was made using participant observation as the main method for data collection. Likewise, a parallel between andragogy and the reality studied was made evidencing the fact that qualifications fall far short of teacher learning needs, the low motivation generated in this spaces and the distance between the interests of the entities seeking to qualify the teachers and the people qualified.

AB Context: The green and sustainable dimensions take on importance as they need to be incorporated into strategic, tactical and operational objectives in companies and supply chains in order to mitigate negative impacts on the environment and society.
   Method: Based on a review of the state of the art in the Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect databases, from the joint perspective of sustainability and supply chain management, the state of the art in green and sustainable supply chain management is presented.
   Results: The reader is introduced to concepts and trends around the green and sustainable supply chain management field that seek to awake interest in new research and practices to guide the implementation of sustainability in organizations and their supply chains.
   Conclusions: Sustainable supply chain management still faces several academic and practical challenges in terms of implementation, measurement of performance and how models can capture a dynamic and uncertain social and environmental context. There are latent research issues such as management of the circular supply chain, applications in emerging economies or the application of 4.0 technologies.

AB The urban public space -PS- is essential for sustainable, resilient, livable cities. Its relevance is recognized by politicians, institutions, and academia. However, its materialization is not as planned, especially in Andean cities in mountainous reliefs such as Manizales and Medellin in Colombia. This work explored the directives on PS in the national and local regulations established in the territorial ordering plans -POT- of the municipalities, of which there are two versions, two moments. Likewise, it evaluated the PS at the beginning of each POT to determine how much new PS was generated and in which parts of the city, as an indication to analyze the equity in its distribution. Important changes were found between the two generations of POT in both cities in terms of discourses, and in the conceptions of PS, declared intentions of equity, concentration of PS in some urban areas and lack in others. Cities are still far from achieving the goals set in the quantitative indicators and, furthermore, they are losing PS due to private occupation. The challenges are increasing, but in addition to the quantitative, it is necessary to consider characteristics of quality, accessibility and connectivity that give vitality to these spaces.

DE Nietzsche; management; philosophy in management; humanism
AB This paper shows the results of the analysis of some of the ideas of the German philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche and its implications in organizations and management. Emphasis is put on the possibility of justifying that, taken from the German philosopher, a view of humanist cut for human resources management in organizations can be proposed. It is stated that thinking organizations as a mean to favor the development of its members towards the "superhuman" (Ubermensch) is a valuable conception. In addition, organizations are proper places for human beings to develop their conditions, ranging from individuality to the accomplishment of their own pontentiality. The thesis revolved around the "spiritual transformation", the "will of power" and the "eternal return". The objective is to approach philosophy in management matters in order to contribute to the discussion of its fundamental problems that go beyond the technical level that dominates the interested community.

For this reason, the objective of this paper is to show the current perspective of the prison and prison system in Colombia, based on the hermeneutic method, through which it is possible to interpret the application of international instruments that exist in the field of Human Rights, such as American Convention on Human Rights; establish its relationship with the policies of protection and resocialization of persons deprived of liberty in prisons and prisons in the country; and offer as a final result, the implementation of these postulates in the new prison law scheme, focused on the construction of a life project for the prisoner, through personal resources, family support and the effective approach of entities and institutions intervening, tending to achieve full resocialization.

ID PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE
AB Aims: Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) has been reported in 5-11% of the acute myocardial infarctions (AMI), and it could be the only electrocardiographic abnormality in this group of patients. We investigated the mortality in patients with AMI and the presence of RBBB.
   Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted between January 2011 to December 2017 at a university hospital in Bogot & aacute;, Colombia. Records were obtained from all patients who presented at the emergency department with AMI; patients with early transfer and incomplete follow-up were excluded.
   Results: 1015 patients were included, the mean age was 66 years, 67% of the patients were men, and 38% had STEMI. RBBB was documented in 8% of patients and LBBB in 4% of patients. In-hospital mortality was higher in the group of patients with RBBB vs. patients without RBBB (8.64% vs. 3.74%, p = 0.034). The percentage of patients with Killip >= II classification was higher in patients with new RBBB vs. patients with old or unknown duration RBBB (23% vs. 13%, p = 0.216).
   Conclusions: In patients with AMI, the presence of RBBB was associated with a statistically significant increase of in-hospital mortality.

AB We examine the long-term trends observed in the living standard of the Colombian population over more than 180 years. We construct a Historical Index of Human Development (HIHD) for Colombia for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and find modest advances in the index during the nineteenth century, life expectancy being the dimension that contributed most to the Colombian Human Development Index in that century. In contrast, all HIHD components exhibited significant advances during the twentieth century. In particular, social dimensions were the main contributors to a growing Human Development Index in Colombia, and life expectancy was the main driver for both men and women. These achievements are mainly explained by the role of public policies aimed at the improvement of education and health. Next, since life expectancy was the dimension that most contributed to human development in the long run, we empirically examine the role of improvements in the provision of public utilities in the significant reduction of mortality. Our hypothesis is that the reduction of mortality was largely brought about by improvements in the provision of aqueducts and sewerage. To this end, we construct a new dataset using statistics reported by the Colombian government, which included annual information on the main diseases and causes of mortality during the 1916-2014 period disaggregated by departments. Econometric results show that the decline in mortality rates, especially those related to some waterborne diseases, was significantly related to the expansion of aqueducts and sewerage services in the country.

AB This action research study aimed to examine the possible impact of the Daily 6 approach on the oral fluency in English of 13 adolescents. This approach (extension of the existing Daily 5 (TM) framework) introduced a sixth step, "speak to someone", to respond to the lack of oral fluency limiting participants' overall speaking performance in English as a foreign language. Data were gathered through surveys, diagnostic and achievement tests, and recordings using VoiceThread (TM). The coding and a small sample hypothesis test for means analysis unveiled the significance of the Daily 6 approach to enhance oral fluency through technology. Results displayed gains in oral fluency (length of runs, silent pauses, length of pauses, filled pauses, and pace) and positive changes in attitudinal responses within a low-anxiety environment.

   psychology; cultural history; newspaper publication; ethos antioquelio;

AB this article will analyze the imperatives of a psychological discourse that as a collective imaginary and as a new culture was proposed to face the economic, social and subjective challenges of some natives of Medellin in the mid-twentieth century. At the same time, the type of personality that was promoted through "business management of the self" will be analyzed, and how, through the magazine Temas de Medellin (Colombia), the forms and values associated with the processes that promoted a new way of "being in the world" began to become explicit. The objective of this type of story was to promote entrepreneurship, individualism, well-being, work, "race", business, commerce, happiness, company culture, self-worth, spirit management amidst the greed for material goods and wealth, personal development, the power of the mind over the body and spirituality as the values, emotions and pleasures associated with the economy of production and consumption. The text analyzes the values of this type of emerging capitalism as the synthesis of all human aspirations and as the most voluptuous capacity of the citizens of Medellin at that historical moment. For this, the periodic publication Temas is examined, and it is concluded that through educational strategies a social memory was generated for the business profile based on success and class privileges centered on the accumulation of material and human capital, which led to a specific form of social classification summarized under the category of "business management".

AB N-body simulations of the interaction between the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Milky Way are performed to study whether it is possible to reproduce both the bifurcations in the tidal streams and the physical properties of Sagittarius. Both galaxies are simulated as sets of particles (live potentials). The initial structures are formed using GALIC and the gravitational interaction between these galaxies is simulated with GADGET-2. Sagittarius initially is simulated as a rotating disk-type galaxy with two components: dark matter halo and stellar disk and the Milky Way is a disk galaxy with three components: dark matter halo, stellar disk and central spheroid. Several numerical simulations of the interaction of this galaxy with the Milky Way with angles between the orbital angular momentum and the disc angular momentum in the range 180 degrees <= theta <= 0 degrees were performed, showing that, although the position and physical properties of Sagittarius are not reproduced entirely by the remnant, the bifurcations appear clearly when 180 degrees <= theta < 90 degrees.

AB The historical treatment and the current management given to the right to territory in the head of the ethnic groups of the country have led to the struggle of their rights transcending legal-institutional areas, which generates new spaces of conflict and resistance from where the legal, illegal, and alegal aspects will be approached. In this context, the Nasa people of the North of Cauca resist the dispossession and the displacement to which they have been subjected through the liberation of mother earth, a political and ecological process of taking land by advocating for the defense of the territory in the face of abuses of chemicals and monocultures. From the accompaniment to the communities of northern Cauca, the tension between legitimacy and social uses of illegality in the processes of defense and struggle for the territory is problematized.

AB Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that requires the accompaniment of a caregiver who is in charge of assisting and supervising basic and psychosocial needs. The objective of this article was to determine the influence of the caregiver on the cognitive and functional decline of patients with dementia. The method was a systematic review by searching the Scopus, Pubmed and Science Direct databases between the years 2010-2020. In conclusion, the informal caregiver condition was the most reported by the investigations, generally assumed by wives and children; Caregiver characteristics such as personality, subjective interpretations of the functional status of adults with dementia, and caregivers' coping strategies were associated with a decrease in the rate of cognitive and functional impairment of people with dementia.

AB This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a virtual intervention focused on enhancing self-esteem and wellbeing in teenagers of the national police academy schools, with a quasi-experimental study with 194 students (Age range: 12-17 years, M = 13.76 years, S.D. = 1.089; 58.4 % women) randomly assigned by groups. The intervention consisted in four synchronic meetings, a workshop for parents, an individual counseling and a notebook for asynchronous activities. The intervention was based on the reasoned/planned action theory, and Bronfenbrenner's ecological model. Participants completed the Questionnaire for the Assessment of Psychopathology in Adolescents pre and post intervention. Results with 135 students that finished the intervention (70 experimental and 65 control) showed that those who received the intervention showed less uncertainty about the future and depression than those in the control group. Self-esteem and wellbeing slightly increased, but it was not statistically significant compared to control. Learned lessons are discussed and recommendations for improvement of the intervention are given. This study concluded that the intervention is feasible to reduce the levels of uncertainty and depression in adolescents, which could later have an impact on improving self-esteem and well-being.

DE Green's functions; beams on elastic foundation; piles; displacement
   field
AB Beams on elastic foundation are basic elements within structural analysis, which are used to model foundation beams, foundation piles, retaining walls, and more complex structures that include some of these elements. For their analysis, the finite element method is usually used [1], which produces an approximate solution of the problem; and the Green's function stiffness method [2], which produces an exact solution. This article presents a methodology 100 % based on the use of Green function's (response to a unit point force), to obtain the exact response of beams on elastic foundation. The main advantage of this formulation is its computational low cost compared to the aforementioned alternatives, and even for a large number of problems, it can be expressed only by means of sums and integrals, which can be easily performed numerically.
   Also, a great variety of Green function's for finite and infinite beams on elastic foundations with different boundary conditions are also presented, as well as some examples with the implementation of the proposed methodology.

SO PROLEGOMENOS-DERECHOS Y VALORES
LA Spanish
DT Review
DE Constitutional Court; constitutional review; court supremacy; living
   law; legal provision; legal regulation
AB The article argues that the Constitutional Court has used the provision/regulation distinction by strategically exerting control over the jurisprudence of high courts in order to recognize its functional superiority as guardian of the Constitution and obtain judicial support for its decisions, avoiding direct confrontations or "choque de trenes" with such courts. As a result, some ambiguities about the conception and application of living law are presented. To formulate this hypothesis, the article is divided into three parts. The first one presents the use of the provision/regulation distinction and its political repercussions and then systematically reconstructs the doctrine, meaning and scope of living law, as a constitutional scenario in which such distinction is applicable. The second part evaluates the strategic use of clarity and ambiguity in the doctrine, interpreting the sense of constitutional validity of living law, how it is controlled with respect to the legal community and its extension to the inter-American jurisprudence. The last part summarizes the conclusions.

AB The effect of the presence of copper was evaluated on a bimetallic catalyst Au-Cu based on mixed oxide cerium-zirconium in the preferential oxidation of CO (CO-PROX). Six catalytic materials, based on mixed oxides, were prepared: (1) the support (CeZr); the monometallic catalysts, i.e. (2) gold (Au/CeZr), (3) impregnated copper oxide (CuOx/CeZr) and (4) incorporated copper (CuCeZr); and the bimetallic catalysts, i.e. (5) impregnated copper oxide and gold (Au-CuOx/CeZr), and (6) gold and incorporated copper (Au/CuCeZr). The catalysts were evaluated in the CO-PROX in the range 30-300 degrees C and atmospheric pressure, where the Au-CuOx/CeZr showed the best catalytic behavior. The influence of CO2 and H2O in the feed stream was evaluated on the catalytic performance of the Au-CuOx/CeZr. An inhibitory effect for the CO2 was observed, while the presence of H2O enhanced the performance. Additionally, the catalytic stability was evaluated, reaching CO conversion of 93 % and selectivity of 90% for 118 h. The catalytic materials were characterized by XRD, showing in all cases the fluorite cubic structure. The N-2 adsorption-desorption analyses showed that synthesized materials were mesoporous and the TPR-H-2 test reveals that the presence of the active phase increases the reducibility of Ce4+ to Ce3+. Reduction peaks of the gold catalyst were present at lower temperatures than those of the copper catalyst, which is related to a hydrogen spillover phenomenon. Finally, the samples were analyzed by SEM and TEM, which confirmed the formation of nano-particles with a diameter of about 4 nm.

AB Background: Congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis (CNPAS) is a rare cause of nasal obstruction in neonates with respiratory distress manifestations. Diagnosis is made with craniofacial computed tomography, prompt and precise treatment creates good outcomes in these patients.
   Aim: To present our experience in diagnosis and management considerations with this rare pathology and a case series of our surgically managed patients.
   Methods: A retrospective, analytical study of CNPAS patients surgically managed over a period of seven years. Evaluation and follow up was reviewed.
   Results: Thirteen patients were evaluated; pyriform aperture mean width was 5.5 mm. Of these patients, 31% also had Congenital Midnasal Stenosis. Medical treatment failed for all the patients and they required surgical enlargement of the pyriform aperture. No complications were seen and all patients improved in symptoms and development.
   Conclusions: Congenital nasal obstruction can be fatal in new-borns, CNPAS is a rare differential diagnosis that must be completely evaluated, properly treated with conservative management and if it fails, with well-planned and executed surgery. Follow-up shows high rates of success. (C) 2019 Sociedad Espanola de Otorrinotaringologia y Cirugia de Cabeza y Cuello. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

AB With the passage of time in civil, commercial and international law, the true value of arbitration awards and the recognition of arbitral law as private justice has been questioned, thanks to the origin of the action of protection against decisions, then unique to the referees. Reason why the interest of writing this article has as its purpose to question, the action of guardianship as a limit to the autonomy of the private will of the parties when choosing the arbitration to settle their disputes is addressed.
   Despite the state recognition of Arbitration, as an alternative mechanism for the resolution of conflicts, as provided for in the Political Constitution of Colombia, the legislative development and international treaties on the matter in particular, on occasion of the constitutional judicial control generated by the discharges Courts, specifically by the Constitutional Court of Colombia through the tutela action, it is noteworthy that, in recent years, this control has become the focus of arbitral law.
   Since, with the provenance of this action, the validity, efficiency, speed, confidentiality, economy and suitability of the arbitration awards have been questioned, since apparently, the Constitutional Court has been ruling on material aspects and not procedural is their decisions, which affect the enforcement of the arbitral award and in turn generate legal uncertainty for those who come to him.

AB This paper investigates optimal consumption and retirement choices in an environment without labor market frictions but in which agents face liquidity constraints. To this end, we characterize the optimal savings strategy and the threshold level of assets associated with the decision to retire or not, which in turn yield the optimal consumption and work choices. In line with the literature, we show that wealth plays a crucial role since it determines whether or not it is optimal to save and then to retire. However, our results differ from the conventional view as we find that, for those workers with low levels of assets, retirement is never optimal regardless of income uncertainty.

ID DISEASE
AB The aim of this study was to explore the development of pressure during the writing of words, as a fundamental parameter of the written signal, specifically in the handwriting of block letters, in Spanish. Studies using other types of writing and in other languages have observed the phenomenon of PROGRESSIVE MOTION VARIABILITY: pressure for word final letters was higher than for initial letters, which was also true for pressure variability. Forty university students participated and copied a set of 72 words, 36 of which started with one of the graphemes of interest (<a>, <e>, <l>, <r>; e.g., abdomen); the other 36 words ended with one of these graphemes (e.g., diploma). A graphic tablet and electronic ink pen served to record the data. The word final grapheme showed a higher average pressure and pressure variability than the word initial grapheme. We also found differences between graphemes. This means that in Spanish the characteristics of the trace of a letter depend on letter identity but also on its position in the word. This is an important fact to take into account in future studies analyzing this parameter.

AB Pillar replacement in mining works is a technique of using the pillars that are part of the support structures having a high degree of mineralization, which attracts economic interest. The technique consists of replacing the support pillars of the mineral matrix that contain appreciable and beneficial quantities of mineral by artificial pillars that provide geomechanical structure to the operations, generating support and safety benefits greater than or equal to those provided by the original pillars and thus maximizing the intrinsic economic value of the available rock in the operation. Based on the literature regarding design techniques for the assembly of pillars used in underground gold mining, daily and continuous field inspections were conducted for two months, taking the necessary data for the proposed design following ISRM standards for data collection. The proposed pillars must consider a set of operational economic requirements and meet the geomechanical performance required to guarantee the safety and stability of the site. The design consisted of a combination of two types of pillars, one of concrete and one of mesh, cables and sterile material (granodiorite and dyke). The measurements consisted of RMR determination, the dimensions of the current pillars, and the geomechanical condition using detailed scanlines. Subsequently, the information was refined and correlated, and the degree of fracture and safety factor of the original pillars versus those proposed in the new designs were calculated. As a result, the optimal design for the construction of the replacement pillars should have dimensions of 2 x 1.7 x 1.7 meters, achieving a safety factor of 1.36, complying with the geomechanical requirements of safety and stability and yielding a profit of 405 % as a cost-benefit ratio in replacing the original pillars by those proposed in the design; the sterile material and mesh pillars would have dimensions of 2 x 2 x 2 meters.

AB This research article is the result of research on the project entitled, Public Policy, Law and Social Movements. The objective of this research is to present how popular consultations have been developed in Colombia regarding extraction processes. This is to demonstrate how this participation mechanism has become a tool for environmental advocacy and the fight of communities against the extractive model. The research question is how popular consultations are being used by Colombian society so as to question the extractive model? The research method tackles a socio-legal field as it confronts a social fact against a normative element of citizen participation, its approach is qualitative and the research tools stem from the documentary analysis. The article concludes that popular consultations in the context of the mining energy conflict have been important insofar as the communities affected by the extractivist model might exercise their right to decide whether or not to implement the energy mining model. The above-mentioned tools were innovative and effective; however, Colombian high courts have curtailed the effectiveness of these constitutional actions.

AB We analyze how the students of primary and secondary schools, from rural and urban areas, reconstructed the history of Colombian Independence. We developed a descriptive observational study with a cross-sectional measure involving a narration generating question applied to an intentionally selected sample of 43 students. We analyzed the independence or relation of the categories: historiographic knowledge (e.g., the use of historical sources, explanatory factors, historical temporality), and narrative macrostructure (e.g., use of the Labov and Waletzky model, 1967/1997). Results indicated oral productions by the students, from narrative and historiographic macrostructures, were unsophisticated and far from the historical disciplinary discourse. In addition, historical narratives in rural and urban contexts were similar. We suggest the need to re-evaluate the kind of historical narratives circulating in the school classrooms, as a way to increase the level of historical complexity in the available stories about independence.

AB The neoliberal discourse supposes a dictatorship of the symptom, which steals in a certain way the singularity of the subject. This ideology is the producer of a series of symptoms and psychosocial malaise for whose treatment a series of therapies whose foundation rests in the very heart of the ideology have proliferated. In this sense, the present article of reflection, the current consumption of consciousness received by the therapeutic dimensions, rather than allowing the subject to fit into the subjective subject in a creative and denouncing way, takes a dive into the unstoppable game of the push of capital, game in which the promise of happiness rests.

TI EVIDENCE FORA FACILITATORY EFFECT OF SYLLABLE FREQUENCY IN WORDS READING
   FROM SPANISH SPEAKING SCHOOLCHILDREN IN GRADE 2 AND 5
SO RLA-REVISTA DE LINGUISTICA TEORICA Y APLICADA
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Reading; syllable; sublexical processing; syllable frequency;
   development
ID LEXICAL DECISION; RECOGNITION; PROGRAM; MODEL
AB Investigations of reading in Spanish and other languages have shown that adults recognize words with a frequent first syllable more slowly than words with an infrequent first syllable, providing evidence for sublexical-syllabic processing. The common interpretation of this inhibitory effect of syllable frequency is that it results from competition among candidate words that supposedly become activated based on the first syllable. Investigations with children have found varied results, sometimes showing an inhibitory effect (as in adults) or sometimes a facilitative one. It is unclear whether this results from different processing in children, because there are differences in experimental design and the selection of the verbal material that could account for these inconsistencies. The aim of the current study was to put to the test the effect of first-syllable frequency in Spanish-speaking children, with words controlled for potential confounding variables that had previously produced an inhibitory effect in adults. We measured reaction times in a lexical decision task presented to 90 Colombian schoolchildren, from 2nd and 5th grades of primary school. Results in this task showed faster recognition for words with a frequent first syllable. One could conclude tentatively that sublexical variables (in this case, the syllable) play a role in reading, beginning in childhood, although syllable processing differs in its pattern from that observed in adults, producing a facilitatory effect in children and an inhibitory effect in adults.

DE Bioethics; gender; body; autonomy; social justice
AB This article reflects the experience from seminar called: "From the body without justice to subjects with justice" at Bioethics Department in Universidad El Bosque. The seminar, which from now on will be named "Bioethics, gender and social justice" was held during the second semester of 2015 and the first semester of 2016, The seminar came as a result of a previous research of the doctorate in bioethics entitled "Respect for the autonomy of pregnant women in health attention: A bioethics-gender dialogue" that inquired into pregnant women bodies and autonomy. The investigation left diverse inquisitiveness such as: questions about the boundaries between autonomy and justice and profound concerns on social justice and inequality against women, among others.
   The before-mentioned aspects opened the analysis and debate about social justice in relation to the female body, gender and human reproduction from the bioethics-gender approach. Through the seminar it was concluded that autonomy and social justice weave together because the autonomous subjects are the ones who claim social justice.

LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Comic strip; false hero; Roberto Fontanarrosa; myth; Boogie; el aceitoso
AB This article provides a study of the main character in the comic series Boogie, el aceitoso from three convergent perspectives. Each of these perspectives stem from our own subjective experiences as young readers of Boogie, but they are also informed by current academic concepts. The first perspective addresses the character of Boogie as a false hero in opposition to a myth that provides a heroic interpretation of the character's motives. The second analyzes both the work of Daniel Samper Pizano-the renowned Colombian writer and journalist-as a cultural mediator, and the impact that this work had on the readership of a national newspaper in Colombia. Finally, the third perspective focuses on the aesthetic aspect of Boogie, the style of the drawings and the composition of the frames created by Fontanarrosa. The conclusion about the short-lived presence of Boogie in Colombian newspapers points to the idea that a criminal false hero was too sophisticated a parody for a society that, facing waves of violence, was unable to accept and comprehend the criticism incorporated in the character.

AB Background: Traumatic brain injury and cerebrovascular disease may lead to motor, behavioral, and/or cognitive disabilities. The associated neurologic and vascular damage triggers a chain of events that lead to a secondary brain injury (SBI), a preventable cause of adverse neurological outcomes. Proper prevention of these factors may limit undesirable outcomes. This article presents a concept analysis that aims to form a single definition of the term secondary brain injury for nursing personnel. Methodology: Concept analysis was used to clarify the concept of SBI. An electronic search was performed on existing nursing literature dating from 1995 to 2016 on PubMed, MEDLINE, Ovid Journal, Wiley, and ProQuest. Results: A clear definition and description of the attributes, antecedents, and consequences of SBI increases the knowledge and level of recognition of the secondary injuries. This may lead to strategies that reduce the risk of long-term effects (disability) and poor clinical outcomes. Conclusions: This concept analysis contributes to the endeavor of identifying phenomena that are pertinent for nursing; it also provides a basis for future research that leads to improving nursing interventions and creating educational programs and healthcare policies that prevent or eliminate the consequences of SBI.

TI Optimized Hierarchical Control for an AC Microgrid Under Attack
SO INGENIERIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Microgrid; cyber-attack; distributed control; hierarchical control
AB Context: An inverter-based microgrid working in islanded mode can suffer cyber-attacks, these can be done against either the local controller or the communication links among the inverters. Secondary control is able to reject those attacks, however, a tertiary control action is necessary in order to stabilize the power flow among the microgrid.
   Method: Confidence factor technique allows to reject attacks in a microgrid acting directly over the secondary control, however, this technique omits other factor related to the power available. In this case, secondary control was complemented with a tertiary control that includes optimization criteria.
   Results: An inverter-based microgrid is simulated in Matlab for different scenarios and under cyber-attack, this allows checking the correct response of the controller under attacks and the effective power-sharing among inverters.
   Conclusions: The tertiary control allows stabilizing the active power of the system after the rejection of a cyber-attack by the secondary control. Each inverter supplies active power according to its maximum power rating without affecting the stability of the whole system.

TI New Algorithms for delta gamma-Order Preserving Matching
SO INGENIERIA
LA English
DT Article
DE String searching; experimental algorithm analysis; strings similarity
   metric
AB Context: Order-preserving matching regards comparing the relative order of symbols within different strings. However, its application areas require more flexibility in the matching paradigm. We advance in this direction in this paper that extends our previous work [27].
   Method: We define delta gamma-order preserving matching as an approximate variant of order-preserving matching. We devise two solutions for it based on segment and Fenwick trees: segtreeBA and bitBA.
   Results: We experimentally show the efficiency of our algorithms compared to the ones presented in [26] (naiveA and updateBA). Also, we present applications of our approach in music retrieval and stock market analysis.
   Conclusions: Even though the worst-case time complexity of the proposed algorithms (namely, O(nm log m)) is higher than the Theta(nm)-time complexity of updateBA, their Omega(n log n) lower bound makes them more efficient in practice. On the other hand, we show that our approach is useful to identify similarity in music melodies and stock price trends through real application examples.

AB The gold mineralization located in Vetas, Santander, consists of auriferous quartz veins hosted in Bucaramanga gneiss rocks, intrusive Jurassic rocks, and intrusive to porphyritic Miocene rocks. This study identified four mineralizing events: (1). Sericite, carbonate (ankerite and calcite?), massive and microcrystalline quartz, sphalerite, adularia, albite, galena, thin pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite. The age for this stage is 10.78 +/- 0.23Ma (Ar/Ar on sericite). (2). Molybdenite, magnetite with exsolution of ilmenite, As-pyrite, sphalerite, fine-grained pyrite and little chalcopyrite quartz with huge, feathery, fine mosaic, flamboyant and microcrystalline textures and, tourmaline and sericite. (3). Gold and tennantite associated with sphalerite, fine- and coarse-grained pyrite, As-pyrite, chalcopyrite like inclusions, and quartz with flamboyant, mosaic, massive and "comb" textures, and tourmaline. Stage 2 and 3 happened from 7.58 +/- 0.15 Ma to 6,89 +/- 0,41Ma (Ar/Ar on sericite). (4). Thick, thin, and pyrite with arsenic, hematite and microcrystalline quartz (forming breccia texture), and sericite. The age for this stage is 5.24 +/- 0.10 (Ar/Ar on sericite). Post-mineral: quartz comb, alunite, halloysite, kaolinite, and ferrum hydroxides.
   The stable isotopes,.18O,.D, and.34S and fluid inclusions analysis infer that fluids were producing a mixture of meteoric and magmatic fluids with low salinity and minimum trapping temperatures between 200 degrees C to 390 degrees C.
   The mineralogy association, and fluid inclusions, in the first event show characteristic of low sulfidation epithermal. The second stage was hottest and with more magmatic signature over printed an intermediate sulfidation system; show a little more salinity on the fluids and more mineralogical diversity, the third and four events, could show an evolution of this fluid, where it was cooling and impoverishing on metals. Two initials stages are contemporaneous with two magmatic Miocene pulses on the area: the first one of granodiorite composition 10, 9 +/- 0.2 Ma (U/Pb zircon), and the other one rhyodacite with 8.4 +/- 0.2 y 9.0 +/- 0.2 Ma.

AB Medication errors represent one of the main causes of incidents and adverse events during the perioperative period. Therefore, this study analyzes errors before, during, and after the administration of general anesthesia for abdominal surgery at a high-complexity hospital in Bogota, Colombia. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 390 patients between January and September 2019. Of the 3,677 medication administrations, some type of error was made in 60% of cases, mostly in emergency surgeries. The pharmacological group with the most errors was general anesthetics, with 32%. All identified errors constituted situations with harm potential, indicating the need to promote the standardization of activities involving the use of medications and a culture of healthcare safety in order to avoid adverse events.

AB The Jehovah's Witnesses are a christian community focused on transmitting Jesus' teachings. In their regular preaching activities, they use publications that present numerous rhetorical strategies aimed to persuading the public. The present work analyzes one of the most recurrent strategies: metaphors. For this, similes and analogies from two of their books for adolescents were taken as the corpus. The identification of characteristics, patterns, and communicative effectiveness allows the researcher to select metaphors that reflect their belief system, and it is verified that this discursive strategy is efficient to reproduce that system.

AB The accelerated rhythm with which technology advances globally brings with it new ways of human interaction in digital environments. This digital way of communicating and exchanging information has allowed the birth of digital badges in order to identify and recognize an achievement, a skill, a competence, abilities or another matter specific to that relationship. This study explores the feasibility conditions to implement a police digital badge system as a tool to identify, motivate, promote, provide feedback and recognize the competencies, skills and abilities of its members. Using a qualitative approach, this study establishes the emerging categories and subcategories and the main aspects necessary for their design and implementation. Taking into account the results obtained, it is concluded that a system of police digital badges (SIDPo) represents an institutional opportunity to innovate, validate and recognize the competencies, skills and abilities of the police professional in digital ecosystems, facilitating digital interaction with the community and the Colombian state in real time, especially in those events in which institutional achievements are unknown due to the rigidity of official communications.

AB Objectives To present a historical-critical analysis of theconfiguration processof the 2009-2010 flu pandemic in order to show the relationships between thisprocessand the organization of world power, and to promote social and political mobilization. Methods Primary and secondary sources on the dynamics of the 2009-2010 flu pandemic were studied. The sources were validated by plausibility assessment and historiographical analysis. From a historical-territorial and critical approach, the relations between the worldconfigurationof the pandemic and the economic, political, and ideological power relations of contemporary capitalism were identified. Results It is revealed that the expanding monopoly of the pig industry provided favorable conditions for the evolutionary explosion of the influenza A(H1N1) virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) made decisions that were inclined toward the economic interests of the pig and pharmaceutical industries within the framework of financial-cognitive capitalism. Conclusions The modes of conduct of these institutions and companies materialized the world relations of economic, political, and ideological power of our time, which determined theconfiguration processof the pandemic. The worldwide spreading of the virus is barely a trail of theprocess.

AB Countries all over the world struggle to exploit their Unconventional Hydrocarbon Resources (UHR) to secure energy supply, but only a few of them have succeeded. Regulators and decision-makers should understand the critical factors required for companies to attract capital, technology, and good practices to promote innovation and generate the virtuous cycle that translates into sustainable production. This study seeks to identify the most relevant factors for UHR commercial development. We assessed the UHR exploiting state in 60 countries and identified the critical common development factors for the 22 that are most active. The proposed Unconventional Hydrocarbon Development Index (UDI) allows to model, rank, benchmark, and forecast UHR development activity for any given country. We focused on the case of Colombia to illustrate the validity of this Index. Evidence suggests countries where National Oil Companies (NOCs) address the challenge of exploiting UHR on their own, may lack the required expertise, despite having governmental support and capital availability. It is easier for them to emulate resilient North American firms exploiting UHR by partnering with them to effectively incorporate best practices Governments can facilitate the process through UHR support, surface and subsurface risk reduction, a proper tax regime, and ESG practice promotion.

AB Water management of strawberry cultivation is one the main problems of for crop production in Colombia causing fruit loss or malformation. The objective of this work was to evaluate the use of thermographic images as a tool to detect water stress in strawberry cultivation, using the crop water stress index method (CWSI). Plants of two strawberry varieties (Fragaria x ananassa Duch) were irrigated withoptimum and slight hydric deficit conditions, in a high tunnel system at the Savannah of Bogota. Environmental variables (temperature, relative humidity, PAR radiation and vapor pressure deficit) and physiological variables (canopy temperature, substrate moisture content and stomata conductance) were monitored for five months, in order to validate the hydric status of the crop through the use of CWSI. It was concluded that using thermographic images is a valid tool to detect hydric stress in protected small crops, given its high correlation with other methods and is one of the most complete monitoring methods for water management, since it relates to physiological characteristics of the crop with environmental variables that affect it.

That must be a guide of principles be guiding principles of behavior and professional excellence. However, this education has proven to be ineffective. As a result, it is common to find errors of an ethical nature in the practice of disciplines. With the need to transcend the theoretical ethics training, and in the seek of practical and applied education, in order to promote the development of autonomous professionals, responsible, and in a sense of excellence in professional act, have compiled training experiences based on promoting critical and reflective thinking. First, a theoretical review focused on the main shortcomings of education in ethics. In the second place, on teaching strategies that have proven valuable for cultivation of deliberation and critical and reflective thinking in students collected performed. Finally, because of the research and understanding the need to bring the information collected to teachers engaged in educational transformation, a dynamic booklet was carried out, friendly to the reader and in order to be a support to teachers in charge of teaching ethics in the universities. The booklet content was validated level through an expert judgment and analysis to V of Aiken, showing conceptually be consistent and useful according to the objective there of.

AB The aim of this review was to synthesize the methodological approach that has been studied and integrate the findings of the grief process in caregivers of children who died of cancer. A scoping review was conducted of 19 studies published in journals indexed between 2010 and 2017. The findings were treated with open inductive coding techniques. The results showed a mostly qualitative approach, involving mother and father, with one year between the death of the child and the entry into the study. The results of the studies revealed that because grief is lived as a response to the physical rupture of the bond with the child, it is through the work on bonds that grief can be overcome. The key bonds are those with the deceased child, with the living children, with the spouse, with the family and the health team. Therefore, continuous and compassionate accompaniment of the caregiver is required from the moment of the diagnosis of the child with cancer, which allows the construction of assertive bonds. After the death of the child, it is necessary to maintain the continuity of care and encourage the caregiver to participate in support groups.

DE Suicide; critical analysis of discourse; expert discourse; cultural
   practices; technoscience
AB The aim of this paper is to reflect on the theoretical tools that critical discourse analysis provides to an understanding of the phenomenon of suicide. Two discussions are central to defining the foundation for that relationship. First, a critical examination of the relationship between different mass media platforms and the idea of imitation as it pertains to suicidal conduct is proposed. Subsequently, suicide is approached as a practice that is interpolated by social, political, and cultural constructions, not solely limited to psychopathology. Finally, the role of critical discourse analysis generates an understanding of suicide that problematizes the hegemonic narratives produced by the epistemological and political demands of technoscience.

DE pollution; development; needs; Pauna; water resource; sustainability
AB Introduction: This article is the outcome of a research called "Strategies for integrated and sustainable management of water resources", carried out during 2017 and 2018 in the municipality of Pauna, located in the west of the Department of Boyaca.
   Problem: The unsustainable use of water resources by the population of the municipality makes it a problem of social and environmental priority. The water in the municipality has been used for more and more numerous purposes that seek to meet the needs that arise from economic and tourist development.
   Objective: To formulate management strategies for the efficient use of water in the residential, commercial and tourist consumption sectors of the municipality.
   Methodology: The efficient use of water implies understanding and characterizing the habits, in addition to the consumption sectors, and verifying the water quality, to create environmental management strategies through open type descriptive surveys, and sampling struts were used to assess the variation in water quality.
   Results: The unsustainable use of water resources is linked to the use of obsolete faucets, increasing demand for development and tourism, and general maintenance of spas.
   Conclusion: This project seeks to generate a change in the behavior of the use towards efficiency, and the modification of the practices of the users to favor the sustainability of the inhabitants.
   Originality: Strategies of integrated and sustainable management of water resources are formulated for the first time in the municipality of Pauna.
   Limitations: The lack of information provided by the municipality, and access to the sampling points.

AB The article explores the academic transformations highlighted by the students during their university education in a hostile society. Qualitative methodology was used, taking testimonies, observations and conversations where young people establish the importance of their student experience. The inquiry focused on the training process, the intellectual competencies, the individual effort and the students' relationships with the teachers. Despite constant criticism of the university, especially the public university, participating in the training process offers students a window into the world other than those who are outside higher education, who may be groups of origin or with whom they share their daily life; his passing through the university are proposed as an alternative that offers students elements to understand how to develop their training, find himself and interpret and act on the events of their immediate reality.

DT Article
ID INTERVENTION; VOLATILITY; BANK
AB Many central banks that have opted for monetary autonomy have also been reluctant to relinquish control over the value of their currencies. As a result, they have operated through both interest rate and foreign exchange interventions. Using daily data from the Central Bank of Turkey during the period of 2002-10, we study the effects of simultaneous policies by first purging the intended monetary decisions from responses to real-time macroeconomic variables and then determining their impact on economic activity. We find that the Central Bank of Turkey adjusted its policy rate mostly in response to inflation levels relative to both the yearly target and agents' expectations, and conducted purchases and sales of foreign currency in response to exchange rate behavior. These responses varied depending on whether interventions were pre-announced. In terms of effectiveness, we find that unannounced purchases of foreign currency had a significant effect in reducing exchange rate volatility but appeared to have no effect on exchange rate changes. Announced interventions, on the other hand, did have a significant impact on exchange rate changes and volatility. Finally, we find that changes in the policy rate affected inflation and output growth, with a lag delay of four and two quarters, respectively.

AB To estimate the degree of concordance and consistency in the radiographic and tomographic evaluation of the periapical area. A study of diagnostic tests was designed. Three blind evaluators analyzed radiographic images, which were selected at two different points in time. An oral radiologist and an endodontist determined the second observation moment. The degree of similarity and variability, concordance and consistency for each radiograph was set at 95% confidence. A Kappa coefficient (kappa), for radiographic findings and a correlation coefficient of Lin (CCC) for tomographic measurements was established. 12 radiographies and 19 tomographs were evaluated. The intraobserver consistency determined a k= 1 (Almost Perfect) and a CCC from 0.42 to 0.95 (Poor to Substantial) for both observation times. For radiographies, the interobserver concordance did not show changes between the first and second observation. Values include a k= 0.56-0.80 (Moderate to Good) and a CCC with greater degree of agreement, after training, as follows: axial view: CCC 0.86, 95% of Confidence Interval (CI) 0.69-0.94, coronal view: CCC 0.90 95%CI 0.75-0.96, and sagittal view: CCC 0.96, 95%CI 0.90-0.98. The statistical tests estimated the consistency and concordance to observe radiographically and tomographically the periapical tissue in endodontics.

AB Accurate and efficient measurement of fluid velocities in several kind of experiments, has been acquiring high relevance, for several kind of applications. Particle Image Velocimetry is a noninvasive technique which also provides velocity estimates in several points of the measuring region. Regarding the PIV computations, high resolution of the digital input images, may lead to poor performance. There are also many error sources, regarding the PIV setup itself. This paper describes a method aimed both to speeding up the PIV computations, and minimizing the divergences (noise) present in the output velocity fields. The obtained results are promising, obtaining a speedup of up to 55%, with respect to the traditional cross correlation based method, with a comparable precision.

In the case of Colombia, the exhibition responded to the discourses of progress of the conservative hegemony of the late 19th and the early 20th century, characterized by a rapprochement between the Government and the Catholic Church through the Concordat of 1887. Both the exhibition and the National Congress of Missions were spaces of legitimization of the national project, and sought to justify the continuity of the missionaries' work throughout the national territory.

DE burnout; cynicism; emotional exhaustion; professional efficacy;
   incentives; police
AB This article presents the results of the study carried out in the units of the Metropolitan Police of Bogota, Cali and Barranquilla, in order to analyse whether there is a relationship between the criteria from which burnout syndrome is diagnosed and the benefits and incentives system that the Colombian National Police offers to the uniformed workers who work in the surveillance specialty. For this, a descriptive correlational design was used along with a sample of 1,817 police officers. Among the instruments applied included the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) and the Institutional Survey of Benefits and Incentives; the correlation was performed using the Spearman's Rho statistical test. No prevalence of burnout syndrome was found in the study population and more than half of the police officers stated that in the last year they had received one or more benefits and incentives. In the correlation it was found that the only benefit that reduces the levels of emotional exhaustion and cynicism are recreational activities. In terms of incentives, being congratulated in public seems to mitigate emotional burnout. It is necessary and opportune that psychosocial interventions are carried out to reduce the levels of emotional exhaustion and cynicism, in order to improve the quality of life and well-being of the police; otherwise, the levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization could increase to the point of exacerbating the signs and symptoms of the syndrome.

AB This text aims to point out the focus of local and international regulation on traditional knowledge, which focuses mainly on knowledge associated with biological resources, leaving aside those that do not fall into this category. This poses a challenge for the holders of such knowledge, and the intellectual property system, a challenge regarding building a particular and sufficient system that legally shields such intangibles and their holders. To this end, the current state of the art (normative, conceptual and jurisprudential) will be presented, and then we will observe some protection systems over these intangibles, the Colombian experience, the difficulties derived from the diverse worldview of the holders of this knowledge versus regulation in force, ending with what we believe should contain a particular regulatory system for this knowledge.

AB Finding social accountability in the micro local was the central question of an empirical and novel research that sought answers in three localities that make up the megacity of Bogota. With the design and implementation of various methodological tools, empirical results were sought on the triggers or alarm activation forms in the localities of Usaquen, Chapinero and Usme, in which through a multiple case study, the mediatization was explored in press of the problems, as well as modalities of political participation not related to the electoral behavior, but which are fundamental for the democratic performance and the strengthening of the participation of the civil society organizations in relation to the local government.

AB The insurgency has been characterized by spreading discourses of equality between men and women, linking to its ranks the participation of women as combatants. Taking into account the broad role of women in war, this research asks about the experiences, learning and challenges of women ex-combatants of the FARC-EP guerrilla, the previous, because of the reintegration to civility that They have undertaken these women derived from the signing of the Acuerdo Final para la terminacion del conflicto y la construccion de una paz estable y duradera. For the above, it inquires about aspects such as health, work, security and others in the ARN registers and, in addition, a semi-structured in-depth interview is conducted with five ex-combatant women of the FARC-EP, residents of the Territorial Space of Training and Reintegration of Icononzo Tolima and in the city of Bogota. Finding that the social context of parenting characterized by state abandonment and the constant presence of the guerrillas, facilitated their entry into the organization; also, there is the resignification of the role of women, becoming a political subject and incident in social change. Likewise, it inquires about motherhood and upbringing, finding women determined with social change in favor of their new families and committed to the fight from the political scene. Finally, the identified challenges include security and fears with the termination of the agreed agreements, which are obstacles to the effective social reintegration of ex-combatant women.

AB This paper aims to check some Nussbaum's reviews, in Hiding from Humanity, about Mill's conception of liberty. The analysis frame is given by constant tension between the utilitarian justification and the justification based on per se value of liberty. This article wants to support the following hypothesis: Millean liberty cannot be criticized for reducing its value to instrumental terms. On the contrary, in order to be loyal with Mill, liberty has a double justification: one based on its utilitarianism and another based on its intrinsic value. We use Bernard Williams's suggestion about the intrinsic value of human goods for supporting the latter. He proposed an important criterion to demonstrate the intrinsic value: coherent relation with other values and other human necessities. Finally, the article briefly exposes the problem of coherence in Millean utilitarianism.

AB The article reflects on ethnographies aimed at understanding textile trades and the way in which they are affected by the material make-up of the practices they study. The text gives an account of the intimate, everyday and collective dimensions that frame textile work and concentrates on three constitutive practices of these tasks: sewing as writing, unravelling and unweaving, and mending. It is pointed out that these dimensions and practices have the potential to interweave ethnographies allowing them to be imagined as therapeutic practices of research and accompaniment, capable of questioning the temporalities and subjectivities of contemporary research.

ID SUCROSE ESTERS; TRANSESTERIFICATION
AB The transesterification reaction of sucrose and fatty acid methyl esters to produce sucroesters was experimentally evaluated using commercial emulsifiers as compatibility agents. Reactions were carried out at temperatures between 100 and 140 degrees C, using emulsifier concentrations in the range of 5 to 15 %wt, and potassium carbonate as catalyst. Fatty acid methyl esters consumption and sucroesters production was monitored by HPLC analysis of samples. Methyl esters conversions around 40 % were obtained with 68 %wt monoester content in sucroesters mixture. Despite the reaction times were reduced by operating at high temperatures and high emulsifier's concentration, multiple substitution and color degradation were observed. Higher productivities of sucroester and higher selectivity to monoesters were obtained when potassium palmitate was used as contacting agent. The lower monoester content in the final product was obtained when using a commercial sucroester emulsifier. Results of this study can be used for preliminary process design in a solvent-free production of biobased sucroesters.

DE Lignocellulosic residues; plastic waste; wood plastic composites
AB This paper presents a general review of the use of plastic and lignocellulosic waste in the production of Wood Plastic Composites (WPC). Wood-Plastic Composites are proposed as a solution to the growing generation of waste. Different mixtures of polymer matrices (plastics) and vegetable reinforcements (lignocellulosic residues) have been evaluated for the WPC production. The mixing of this type of raw material is mainly done using three types of technologies: extrusion, injection and compression molding. It was found that changes in the mechanical properties of the final product depend on the raw material type, the particle size and the fiber proportion used, as well as the addition of binding agents. In the same way, variations in the water absorption capacity, densification and thermal stability of the final compound are reported to increase the amount of fiber in the mixture.

AB An onshore radiometric survey sampled in situ the isotopes U-238, Th-232, K-40, and Rn-222 to build maps of normalized values for each element containing negative and positive radiometric anomalies, which could associate with hydrocarbon deposits in the subsoil. The vertical migration of hydrocarbon, water or other gases would have generated the different isotope anomalies. In four 2D seismic sections of the study area, three on dip direction and another in strike direction, we interpreted unconformities, flooding surface, and maximum flooding surfaces, as well as Cretaceous tops. In structural contour maps made from aforementioned seismic sections, we observe structural highs and structures such as truncations of strata. These structures in-depth coincide with uranium, thorium, potassium and radon anomalies seen on the surface. This oil and gas exploration approach that integrates radiometric and emanometric integrated with seismic prospecting can help to reduce the risk in hydrocarbons projects (however, radiometric anomalies are not uniquely associated with hydrocarbons). This work shows a correlation between radiometric (uranium, thorium, and potassium) and emanometric (radon) data in the surface with structures in the subsurface suck like truncation, that could present hydrocarbon, however, on this sub-basin, there has not been found commercial hydrocarbon.

DE Constrained optimization; air pollution; mathematical modeling;
   pollution norms; Nelder-Mead algorithm
AB Introduction- In this work large areas with sources of pollution emissions are considered, and in most cases they go far beyond industrial areas. Using modeling, monitoring or forecasting in the optimization algorithms, the pollution propagation parameters can be analyzed and ajusted with the negative impact of industrial areas.
   Objective- The objective is to optimize the proposed model using three subsets (reformed without restrictions, with restrictions and not reformed) of pollution sources and their validation.
   Methodology- For the minimization, the Nelder-Mead procedure of local classical optimization was used, which by changing the pitch can find the extremes quite accurate and, in addition, serves for multi-parameter optimization.
   Results- The results obtained allow: the choice of industrial zones size, the location of industries with conditional sources and without restrictions, optimization limits according to the number of iterations or according to the integral of the emissions and valuation of the economic consequences of the solution.
   Conclusions- The mathematical model and algorithm are quite simple in their application and are open for more complexity.

AB This article presents the impact that the traffic generating seed has along with a new burst assembly algorithm on the performance of an optical burst switching network -OBS. In which the implemented assembly algorithm is characterized by being mixed and adaptive, that is, a non-classical algorithm. The OBS network model has some fixed preset parameters, such as the number of channels per optical link, the speed per channel, implementation of classical algorithms in the other processes of the functional network scheme, among others. To evaluate the performance, the amount of transmitted bursts transmitted or the probability of blocking is analyzed. The results show the effect of varying the seed has and the impact of the proposed assembly algorithm on the probability of blocking according to the scenario. Each simulation scenario has a different seed and it is implemented for a specific high traffic volume.

AB The sport is today undoubtedly a mass consumption industry, in it -from the athlete himself, to the broadcasting of the sporting event- multiple intangible assets, and legal businesses in which such intangibles are available. The management of these intangibles is a costly task, but in any case, profitable if done properly. Such management will involve the intervention of different agents with specialization in their respective disciplines, and their contribution will, in our opinion, be carried out in three stages, identification of the intangible, and protection of the intangible and administration of the intangible. There are three stages that the sports industry must perform constantly, to achieve the best results, both sports and business.

   dynamical systems; Energy policies; Modeling
AB The regional integration of electricity markets has been established as desirable among the South American nations to meet demands through the possible consolidation of a unified competing market in the medium term (CAN, 2010). However, what remains to be defined are rules of the game with satisfactory benefits for all parties that have been demonstrated. In this paper we propose a model of power integration based on the Market Coupling scheme, which starts with the modeling of the national markets using the System Dynamics modeling methodology. As a result, the expected behavior of the system is obtained, except in the case of exports, in which, because of the assumption of an infinite transmission capacity between nations, it is seen to surpass the real values found in the market. The work presented in this document (based on two nations, Colombia and Ecuador) allows experimentation for the formulation of the rules of the game necessary in the regional integration of markets.

AB The design of habitable neighborhoods must be guaranteed within the planning of a city; which have an orderly road hierarchy, sufficient green areas and adequate public spaces, allowing, in turn, the integration with the rest of activities of the city. However, when the neighborhood is already built, the work of the planner is aimed at determining its habitability level, in terms of what has already been stated, in order to determine the need for intervention. Thus, the purpose of this article is to assess the habitability of neighborhoods considering mobility and urbanism indicators, through the use of non-traditional techniques in transport engineering such as social cartography, aerial observation and a mobile application (Mobydick). For this, the Asis neighborhood in Tunja (Colombia) was taken as a case study. As a result, it was evidenced that the simultaneous use of interdisciplinary techniques complements the evaluation of habitability in a functional unit such as the neighborhood, from the point of view of mobility.

DE Adaptation; Attention; Brain wave; Computational system; Difficulty
AB Purpose Students have learning difficulties, mainly in processes that involve attention and interpretation of written or spoken language. Technological tools allow to create computational platforms with adaptation aspects depending on the student's characteristics. It is also important to highlight the progress of the measurement of cognitive processes such as attention through NeuroSky's MindWave EEG sensors. This paper aims to present the results of analyzing attention levels of children with learning difficulties, based on the acquired brain waves. As a final result, an adaptive computational system that displays educational activities regarding educational profiles of children is obtained. Design/methodology/approach The Kamachiy-Idukay platform was chosen to make the validation. The platform generates the educational activities according to the students' profile. The validation phases were identification of the test environment, the first environment required a scenario that involved students with learning difficulties, to verify the functionality of the system, when analyzing cases of the students with learning difficulties; identification of two validation criteria, type of educational activity and attention difficulties of the students; and analysis of the brain signal when children interact with the educational content. Findings The adaptation of contents that include music and animations generate higher levels of attention in students with difficulty. The analysis of signals from the NeuroSky sensor to determine the attentional levels in children allowed a generation of content adapted to the characteristics of the difficulty in each child.
   Originality/value Evaluation content adaptation taking into account the signal brain sensor NeuroSky for learning process. The signal brain of the student when interacting with the activities is include in the student profile.

ID MORTALITY; BICARBONATE; ASSOCIATION; RISK
AB Background. Acid-base disorders have been previously described in patients with chronic hemodialysis, with metabolic acidosis being the most important of them; however, little is known about the potential changes in acid-base status of patients on dialysis living at high altitudes. Methods. Cross-sectional study including 93 patients receiving chronic hemodialysis on alternate days and living in Bogota, Colombia, at an elevation of 2,640 meters (8,661 feet) over sea level (m.o.s.l.). Measurements of pH, PaCO2, HCO3, PO2, and base excess were made on blood samples taken from the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) during the pre- and postdialysis periods in the midweek hemodialysis session. Normal values for the altitude of Bogota were taken into consideration for the interpretation of the arterial blood gases. Results. 43% (n=40) of patients showed predialysis normal acid-base status. The most common acid-base disorder in predialysis period was metabolic alkalosis with chronic hydrogen ion deficiency in 19,3% (n=18). Only 9,7% (n=9) had predialysis metabolic acidosis. When comparing pre- and postdialysis blood gas analysis, higher postdialysis levels of pH(7,41 versus 7,50, p<0,01), bicarbonate (21,7 mmol/L versus 25,4 mmol/L, p<0,01), and base excess (-2,8 versus 2,4, p<0,01) were reported, with lower levels of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (34,9 mmHg versus 32,5 mmHg, p<0,01). Conclusion. At an elevation of 2,640 m.o.s.l., a large percentage of patients are in normal acid-base status prior to the dialysis session ("predialysis period"). Metabolic alkalosis is more common than metabolic acidosis in the predialysis period when compared to previous studies. Paradoxically, despite postdialysis metabolic alkalosis, PaCO2 levels are lower than those found in the predialysis period.

ID FIRED CLAY BRICKS; GAS EMISSIONS; CONSTRUCTION; CONCRETE
AB The use of non-biodegradable waste such as glass and plastic in the construction industry has received significant attention for a cleaner environment. This work presents a study of bricks'; mechanical properties containing aggregates, glass, and polyethylene terephthalate pellets. The bricks were melted at a temperature up to 240 degrees C for 3 hours and cooled by natural convection. The results showed that an increase in the content of glass and aggregates generates an increase in density, being higher in the samples with a higher aggregates content. The same trend was observed in compressive strength. The sample with the highest aggregates'; content showed an improvement of 243% compared to the reference (prepared only with plastic). The results indicated that carbon dioxide emissions decreased by around 30% in the prepared samples, compared to traditional bricks. The use of plastic and glass waste in brick production is expected to become a recovery route.

TI Updating the probability of failure of rock wedges
SO EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL

DT Article
DE Uncertainty; probability of failure; rock wedge; random sets;
   reliability
ID DEMPSTER-SHAFER THEORY; RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; CONFLICT
AB In hard rock masses, discontinuities control the slope stability, rather than block matrix breakage. The relative position and orientation of joints and slope face define the most likely mechanisms of failure. Among these mechanisms, the wedge failure is one of the most common modes of failure in which joint sets dip and dip direction, slope geometry and direction, external forces (including water pressure and earthquake) and rock and joints mechanical properties control the stability. The determination of these input parameters is not straightforward, mainly due to their variability and the limited amount of information available. Besides, in most projects, input parameters come from different sources (e.g., expert opinion, back-calculation, laboratory tests, field test or different project stages). Therefore, this limited information from different sources should be appropriately incorporated into the stability analysis to assist the design and decision-making process. In this context, random sets arise as a powerful tool to combine different sources of information and to perform a reliability assessment under limited information. This feature makes it possible to update the probability of failure as new evidence is available. With this framework, this paper presents a reliability assessment of wedge stability in a rock slope of a sandstone quarry, located in Une Cundinamarca, where information on mechanical and geometrical parameters has been collected for 20 years. This approach allowed to update the probability of failure. As a result, an updated probability of failure raging between 0.04 and 0.25 was calculated.

AB Nursing as part of the interdisciplinary equipement requires identifying the complications of a gastrectomy to provide comprehensive care to the patient, the Clavien-Dindo classification is a tool that facilitates this process. The objective of this article is to describe complications of adults with gastric cancer who underwent a gastrectomy from a systematic review of literature. by searching of articles in five indexed data bases. There were included articles full text, English, Spanish and Portuguese languages, years 2008-2018, key words according to thesaurus validated in DECS y MESH, there were built search equations, analysis matrix and Clavien-Dindo classification. Overall, 27 studies accomplished the inclusion criteria, 100% quantitative. The more reported complications in the documents are related with physical and/or emotional aspects like: infection organ space (9.1%); intraabdominal abscess (6.6%), wound infection or seroma (5.6%) anastomotic leaks (4.5%); gastrointestinal pain (3.3%); exhaustion (3.1%) and working alteration (3.1%). What allows us to conclude is that preoperative plays a prevailing function in the surgical process because it has an impact on the post-operative complications, especially in patients that have nutritional alterations, either by excess or by deficit.

AB The text intends to review the international literature on the legal notion of compliance and the way in which it impacts competition law. For this, through an analytical and comparative methodology, the way in which this new institution has been implemented in the competition law of France and in the European Union is analyzed. It follows that, in both cases, US law has had a decisive influence on the transformation of the conception of legal compliance. The institution starts from understanding that the effectiveness of the norm means that it is effectively respected and that respect is not taken for granted, but is presented as a challenge for authorities and companies. It is found that knowledge and dissemination of the ideas involved in the legal notion of compliance can be useful in Colombia as it provides competition authorities and companies with new legal tools with a view to promoting and protecting the existence of competitive markets.

DE Teacher Training; Educational Policy; Liquid Society; Pedagogy; Humanism
AB Upon reflecting on teacher training needs from various perspectives, it is important to consider teacher training strategies required to confront the disastrous socio-economic and cultural consequences produced by liquid modernity. International organizations emphasize the importance of teacher education. Yet, the composition of curriculums for Education majors at universities in Colombia has many gaps and does not include collaborative work or institutional objectives within their teacher training priorities, for example. Many fallacies have also been detected when formulating new educational policies in Colombia, which are misconstrued as necessary to uphold educational quality, but which, actually, violate the professionalization of teachers. Given that today ' s society, characterized by neoliberal policies, savage capitalism and the destruction of life, faces specific educational needs. new strategies must be proposed to prepare teachers to face the nefarious economic and cultural consequences of liquid modernity.

In the first part, I delimit the space in which my reflection is situated. In the second, I present two models used in the English-speaking world to account for the situation of women in philosophy, showing how they can be applied to the space delimited in the first section.

AB Following the tradition of analysing psychological constructs based on language, this instrumental research aims to validate a dictionary of intergroup emotions, whose process was based on the design, conformation, and validation of word lists associated with 38 intergroup emotions, useful to identifying emotions in linguistic corpus analysed, using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (LIWC), whose main function is to identify linguistic and psychological categories in texts. Nine judges divided into three groups rated the words in two parameters (pertinence and relevance of each word with the emotion) and the scores were complemented with an incomplete random block methodology, to estimate the qualification of the remaining words. Acceptable consistency was found among the judges, as well as adjustment of their scores in the Rasch model, which allowed accepting the obtained results. From these ratings, 9 % of the root words associated with 38 emotions (18 negative, 17 positive, and 3 neutral), subsequently supplemented with their respective endings, were cleared.

To do so, an intra-subject design and a two-factor model were used, both with repeated measurements. An ANOVA was also applied to the repeated measurements to examine whether there was any contrast in the medians of the related data (dependent or paired). Based on the statistical analysis of the student's results, this work concluded that these ICFES mock exam tools strengthened the overall results as well as the results in each test component for the Test Saber 110 the student took in 2018.

TI State-Dependent Forward Guidance and the Problem of Inconsistent

SO GERMAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE forward guidance; zero lower bound; central bank announcements; monetary
   policy; threshold
AB Forward guidance can be provided as an unconditional promise, i.e. commitment to a specific low policy rate. Alternatively, the promise may include an escape clause, i.e. a condition defining the state of the economy under which the central bank would not keep such a low rate and, instead, it would revert to setting policy under discretion. The escape clause can be expressed as a threshold in terms of a specific variable. The present paper shows that, when such a threshold is expressed in terms of an endogenous variable (e.g. output, inflation), there are cases where it becomes impossible for the central bank to act in a way that is consistent with its promise. Consistency imposes limits on the policy rate that can be set since reverting immediately to the optimal discretionary rate can be incompatible with exceeding the threshold.

DE Beans; corn; cassava; snack; food security
AB Immersed in the middle basin of the river Otun Risaralda - Colombia are the ECAS Agroecological Schools, with a majority peasant population, which presents a high risk of vulnerability in nutritional aspects, this condition allows us to propose food strategies that overcome some of these requirements and therefore make the most of the agri-food resources available to the community in their environment. In Colombia and especially in the coffee zone, policies have been implemented that allow acquiring fundamental levels in the food security of communities potentially affected by the difficulty in availability, access, quantity, quality and food safety, within this perspective, the objective of the study focuses on the development of a product that may have a high nutritional value, which is accepted organoleptically by the children and adolescents of the ECAS, but that in turn allows to revalue or repower indigenous agro-food goods of the study area, in the framework of the agricultural products recognized by the farmers, 3 stood out after the bromatological and microbiological analyzes: corn, yucca and bean petaco; these presented a significant nutritional value; with them a gastronomic alternative type sweet Snacks (cookies) was developed, using mixtures of 2 of the 3 assets chosen in proportions 25% - 75%, 50% -50% y 75%- 25% (beans-corn and beans-yucca) in each of the tests carried out. The project is based on an applied research implemented an exploratory and descriptive methodology which consists of a mixed approach (qualitative-quantitative). The analysis and data collection allowed obtaining the following results: the best products for the elaboration of the Snack are bean-yucca (25% - 75%) and corn-beans (25%-75%), given the nutritional conditions of the components, organoleptically the best accepted mixture was bean-yucca (25%-75%)
